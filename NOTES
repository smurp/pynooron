* Claims about Nooron:
** Nooron is the automation of meme flow.
** Nooron is the automation of peer review.
** Nooron is the automation of the scientific method.
** Nooron automates the social construction of knowledge.
** Nooron is an infinite game.
** Nooron is the automation of school of ignorance.
** In the context of thought, assertions are the unit of selection.
*** cite Dawkins "genes are the unit of selection"
** the analogue of alleles are versions
** the analogue of biological individuals is a 'presentation' 
  which is essentially a document 
  which is a human authored sequence of arguments 
  which are sets of claims accompanied by conclusions,
  which are either assertions (made by humans based on assertions) 
                or deductions (deduced by machine based on assertions)
** there is a timelessness about the system 
There is no equivalent of 'death' but 
there is 'childlessness' 
the system is then monotonic but supercedable (through versioning).
Hence the entities in the system are never culled but always
flexibly filtered.
** Nooron embodies a new model of scientific communication 
which is knowledge structured at least for human processing,
but ideally, eventually, gradually for automated inferencing.
** It would be a wonderful thing if the initial paper was generated by Nooron.
It would be a presentation -- in the sense above -- where the multiple
arguments would be built from and supported by ontologically grounded 
assertions.  The ontologies, assertions, presentation logic and argument
sequencing would all be knowledge artifacts in the system and subject
to ongoing participatory evolutionary development after the initial authoring.
Hence the initial 'paper' would have side products such as presentation
logics (which would presumably be broadly reusable across domains of 
discourse) as well as ontologies and instances which would be of 
correspondingly increasingly specific reusability.
*** Hence the paper would constitute the seed stock for the noosphere.
*** The Nooron software itself would constitute the matrix for the seed.

* The Nooron MetaHomologies
Identify homologies between Nooron and various systems.
** biological evolution
** scientific method
** evolutionary development as exemplified by process of brain formation
** peer review

* Comparison with other systems
** OHS
** Udanax green
** Udanax gold
** HPKBs
** Ontolingua
** Semantic Web ala TimBL
** Nodal
Instead of replacing the storage model for existing functional models
(structured documents [xml], relational stores [sql]) 

* Nooron and the social construction of knowledge
** Hutchins
** Goldberg

* Documents are dead
** Knowledge is the appropriate granularity
*** Object systems are superceded, but remain servants of knowledge.
*** Relational systems are superceded, but are manipulable as knowledge.
** Long live documents

* Backends to write (legacy functional models to supercede)
** generic sql
** specific relational schemas
** file systems
** versioning systems [e.g. CVS] 
** object systems (use introspection to publish objects as knowledge)
** semantic networks
*** wordnet [a high priority]

* A Project Management perspective on unfolding of Nooron
** need wordnet soon
