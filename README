Welcome to Nooron
=================

Learn a bit about the project:
  http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/Nooron
  http://www.noosphere.org/background

This version depends on:
  Medusa 0.5.3 (or later, presumably, if more come along)
    http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/
  Zope Page Templates included in Zope (tested with 2.5.1)
    http://www.zope.org/Products/Zope/2.5.1
  PyOKBC, but it is included in this Nooron distribution
    htt://www.noosphere.org/software/pyokbc/
  Graphviz is optional, but nice if you want graphics
    http://www.graphviz.org/
    http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/


For now the Nooron license is GPL2.0, if you have wise words on
why this is an error, please tell me.
