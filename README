Welcome to Nooron
=================

Learn a bit about the project:
  http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/Nooron
  http://www.noosphere.org/background

This version depends on:
  Medusa 0.5.4
    known to work with 
      medusa-0.5.4.tar.gz
    which is available from:
      http://www.amk.ca/python/code/medusa.html
    or on Debian (Ubuntu etc) in the package python-medusa
  ZopePageTemplates 2.5
    known to work with 
      ZopePageTemplates-2.5.tgz
    which is available from:
      http://zpt.sourceforge.net/
  PyOKBC, but it is included in this Nooron distribution
    htt://www.noosphere.org/software/pyokbc/
  Graphviz is optional, but nice if you want graphs
    http://www.graphviz.org/
    http://www.research.att.com/sw/tools/graphviz/
    or on Debian (Ubuntu, etc) in the package graphviz
  Docbook-utils (0.6.14-1)
    optional, but very nice if you want:
      tex, rtf, tex, pdf or ps output of the included .dbk templates
    it is in the debian package docbook-utils


    
For ubuntu 8.04 (or probably most recent debian based systems)
  aptitude install python-medusa
  aptitude install ghostscript
  aptitude install docbook-utils
  aptitude install graphviz



For now the Nooron license is GPL2.0, if you have wise words on
why this is an error, please tell me.
