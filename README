Welcome to Nooron

Home:

  http://www.nooron.org/

To understand the scope of the project please see:
  http://www.noosphere.org

This version depends on:
  Medusa 0.5.2 (or later, presumably, if more come along)
    http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/
  The Goose-Works Toolkit
    http://www.goose-works.org
    Gooseworks can use MySQL (and Postgresql too, I think)
  Zope Page Templates
    http://www.zope.org/

This distribution of Nooron contains GWApp.py which is a 
slight modification of Goose-Works' GWSAM.py.  It is likely that
GWApp.py will soon be included in GWTK (Goose-Works).  GWApp.py
has only been tested with an unreleased version of GWTK later than
0.5 (the latest on the gooseworks site as of Aug 4th, 2002.  Many
thanks to Jan Algermissen for access to his ongoing work.

For now the Nooron license is GPL2.0, if you have wise words on
why this is an error, please tell me.
