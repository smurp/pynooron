"""Conversation Pattern Language is a pattern which describes an overview
of conversation for collaboration.  These conversations allow the
declaration of Contexts, which can be other pattern languages, allowing
a group to name its patterns of discourse, as well as evolve them over
time. This language allows a conversation to evolve over time,
coevolving what we know with what we don't know. Some of these patterns
which may shape this process are listed below.

#The Conversation Pattern Language describes conversations which may employ other patterns.
#These patterns are declared as CONTEXTS which allow users to name terms which have special
#as referenced within the conversation.  The collection of contexts for a conversation is called
#its SHELL.  PARTICIPANTS in a conversation may be known to all, according to the CONVERSATION
#POLICY.  New participants are given the opportunity to learn the CONTEXTS in the SHELL when they
#enter the conversation, allowing them to review key patterns and threads of discussion so that
#they may better understand the conversation.
