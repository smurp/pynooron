"""The Conversation Pattern Language describes conversations which may employ other patterns.
These patterns are declared as CONTEXTS which allow users to name terms which have special
as referenced within the conversation.  The collection of contexts for a conversation is called
its SHELL.  PARTICIPANTS in a conversation may be known to all, according to the CONVERSATION
POLICY.  New participants are given the opportunity to learn the CONTEXTS in the SHELL when they
enter the conversation, allowing them to review key patterns and threads of discussion so that
they may better understand the conversation.
