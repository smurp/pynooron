<h3>Welcome to the default front page of a stock Nooron instance.</h3>

<em>Please have patience with the speed of
some of the following pages.  No performance tuning has been done yet, that is the top priority
for the next point release.</em>

<p>This site is served by Nooron; a product whose aim is to be a 
<i>distributed, self-improving container for 
self-improving knowledge and software</i>.
The current
version has been released in the 
spirit of "release early, release often".  
This is the first public release that is conceivably useful.  
This initial release can be considered a dynamic, knowledge-based, 
web-publishing system.  Arbitrary knowledge in, arbitrary XML out.</p>

<h4>Starting points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Nooron FAQ</b>
 (<a href="/know/nooron_faq">local</a>) / 
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_faq">central</a>)
is a good place to find answers to questions like "What is Nooron?"
</li>
<li>For an overview of the thinking behind the entire project, see:
<b>The Nooron Pattern Language</b>
<a href="/know/nooron_pattern_language">(local)</a> /
<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_pattern_language">(central)</a>.
Some of the best views of which can currently only be appreciated by
people who are set up for viewing 
<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/docbook/">DocBook</a> 
or 
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>
files.  
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/">Here</a> are some cached versions of 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_pattern_language_via_docbook.pdf">The Nooron Pattern Language via DocBook</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_pattern_language_via_graphviz.pdf">The Nooron Pattern Language via GraphViz</a>.


</li>
<li>To learn how to create so-called 'Nooron Apps' see:
<b>Nooron App Architecture</b>
(<a href="/know/nooron_app_architecture/?with_template=kb_as_html">local</a>)
/
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_app_architecture/?with_template=kb_as_html">central</a>). It is instructive to examine a graph generated by Nooron (via GraphViz) showing the 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_faq__kb_ancestry.pdf">knowledge-base 'ancestry' of the Nooron FAQ</a>.
</li>
<li>For an example Nooron App here's 
<b>Smurp's Web Log</b>
(<a href="/know/smurp_web_log">local</a>)
/
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/smurp_web_log">central</a>)
</li>

</ul>
In case it wasn't obvious, all of the above 
(except the Nooron App Architecture itself) are 
<a href="/know/nooron_app_architecture/nooron_app_instance">Nooron App Instances</a>.
All the knowledge in this Nooron is available under <a href="/know">/know</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org">Noosphere.org</a>
hosted this project before it became tentatively
self-hosting.  Useful places there include: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/Nooron">Nooron Wiki</a>
(which was mostly just a scratch-pad while working on Nooron)
<li><a href="http://www.noosphere.org/background">Background documents</a>
including old papers and vision statements
<li>the soon-to-be-replaced-by-a-PERT-Nooron-App and already outdated: 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/NooronRoadmap">Roadmap</a></li>
<li>where to get subsequent Nooron releases: 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron">Nooron homepage</a></li>
