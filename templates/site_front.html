<h3>Welcome to the default front page of a stock Nooron instance.</h3>

<p>This site is served by Nooron; a product whose aim is to be a 
<i>distributed container for self-improving 
knowledge, logic and presentation</i>.
Nooron is being released in the spirit of "release early, release often".
This is still an early release.
The system can currently be considered a dynamic, knowledge-based, 
web-publishing system.  Arbitrary knowledge in, arbitrary XML out.  It
also has an easily configurable ability
to render the XML into more convenient display formats (such as
JPEG, Postscript and PDF).</p>

<h4>Starting points:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The <b>Nooron FAQ</b>
 (<a href="/know/nooron_faq">local</a>) / 
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_faq">central</a>)
is a good place to find answers to questions like "What is Nooron?"
</li>
<li>For an overview of the thinking behind the entire project, see:
<b>The Nooron Pattern Language</b>
<a href="/know/nooron_pattern_language">(local)</a> /
<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_pattern_language">(central)</a>.
If you aren't set up to view
<a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a>
files (with the .dot extension) then just tack <code>.ps.pdf</code> on after
so the ends of the urls look like <code>.dot.ps.pdf</code>.  
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/">Here</a> are some cached versions of 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_pattern_language_via_docbook.pdf">The Nooron Pattern Language via DocBook</a>
and 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_pattern_language_via_graphviz.pdf">The Nooron Pattern Language via GraphViz</a>.


</li>

<li>Nooron is, naturally, being used to manage its own development.  
<a href="http://192.168.1.11/know/nooron_pert__aon.dot.ps.pdf">Here</a> is
a PERT chart detailing about half of the steps to version 1.0.


<li>To learn how to create so-called 'Nooron Apps' see:
<b>Nooron App Architecture</b>
(<a href="/know/nooron_app_architecture__kb.html">local</a>)
/
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/nooron_app_architecture__kb.html">central</a>). It is instructive to examine a graph generated by Nooron (via GraphViz) showing the 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/software/nooron/screenshots/nooron_faq__kb_ancestry.pdf">knowledge-base 'ancestry' of the Nooron FAQ</a>.
</li>
<li>For an example Nooron App here's 
<b>Smurp's Web Log</b>
(<a href="/know/smurp_web_log">local</a>)
/
(<a href="http://www.nooron.org/know/smurp_web_log">central</a>)
</li>

</ul>
In case it wasn't obvious, all of the above 
(except the Nooron App Architecture itself) are 
<a href="/know/nooron_app_architecture/nooron_app_instance">Nooron App Instances</a>.
All the knowledge in this Nooron is available under <a href="/know">/know</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org">Noosphere.org</a>
hosted this project before it became tentatively
self-hosting.  Useful places there include: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/Nooron">Nooron Wiki</a>
(which was mostly just a scratch-pad while working on Nooron)
<li><a href="http://www.noosphere.org/background">Background documents</a>
including old papers and vision statements
<li>the soon-to-be-replaced-by-a-PERT-Nooron-App and already outdated: 
<a href="http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/NooronRoadmap">Roadmap</a></li>
<li>where to get subsequent Nooron releases:
