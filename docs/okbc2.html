<h1><a name="SECTION00200000000000000000">
Introduction</a>
</h1>

<p>
This document specifies a protocol for accessing knowledge bases (KBs)
stored in knowledge representation systems (KRSs).  By KRS we mean
both systems that would traditionally be considered KRSs, as well as
can be viewed as a KRS, for example, an object-oriented database. The
protocol, called the Open Knowledge Base Connectivity (OKBC), provides
a set of operations for a generic interface to underlying KRSs.  The
interface layer allows an application some independence from the
idiosyncrasies of specific KRS software and enables the development of
generic tools (e.g., graphical browsers and editors) that operate on
many KRSs.  OKBC implementations exist for several programming
languages, including Java, C (client implementation only), and Common
Lisp, and provide access to KBs both locally and over a network.

</p><p>
OKBC is complementary to language specifications developed
to support knowledge sharing.  KIF [<a href="#kif">4</a>], the Knowledge
Interchange Format, provides a declarative language for describing
knowledge.  As a pure specification language, KIF does not include
commands for knowledge base query or manipulation.  Furthermore, KIF
is far more expressive than most KRSs.  OKBC focuses on operations
that are efficiently supported by most KRSs (e.g., operations on
frames, slots, facets -- inheritance and slot constraint checking).
OKBC is intended to be well impedance-matched to the sorts of
operations typically performed by applications that view or manipulate
object-oriented KRSs.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00210000000000000000">
The Need for a Standard KRS Access Library</a>
</h1>

<p>
There are several motivations for creating a generic access and
manipulation layer for KRS services.  An application programmer may
wish to use more than one KRS during the life of an application.  An
application that initially used the representation services of KRS<sub>1</sub>might later use KRS<sub>2</sub> because KRS<sub>2</sub> is faster, more expressive,
cheaper, or better supported.  Or, an application might use KRS<sub>2</sub><em>in addition</em> to KRS<sub>1</sub> -- KRS<sub>2</sub> might be more expressive for
a subset of tasks, or the application might later require access to a
KB that was implemented using KRS<sub>2</sub>.  In addition,
OKBC supports reuse and composition of multiple ontologies and KBs.
OKBC also allows users to reuse tools and utilities across various
KRSs and applications, such as graphical knowledge editors or
machine-learning programs.

</p><p>
Although there are significant differences among KRS implementations,
there are enough common properties that we can describe a common knowledge
model and an API for KRSs.  An application or tool written to use
these operations has the potential of portability over a variety of
KRSs and knowledge bases.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00220000000000000000">
Overview of the Protocol</a>
</h1>

<p>
OKBC specifies a knowledge model of KRSs (with KBs, classes, individuals,
slots, and facets).  It also specifies a set of operations based
on this model (e.g., find a frame matching a name, enumerate the slots
of a frame, delete a frame).  An application uses these operations
to access and modify knowledge stored in a OKBC-compliant KRS.

</p><p>
The current implementations of OKBC is object-oriented: methods in the
appropriate object-oriented programming language for an application
are used to implement OKBC operations.  We refer to the set of methods
that implement the protocol for a particular KRS as a <em>back end</em>.
Many OKBC operations have default implementations written in terms of
other OKBC operations; therefore, the programmer need define only a
core subset of all OKBC operations in order to implement a compliant
back end.  These OKBC operations are called <em>mandatory,</em> and they
comprise the OKBC <em>kernel</em>.  The default implementations can be
overridden within a given back end to improve efficiency.

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00230000000000000000">
Design Objectives</a>
</h1>

<p>
The design objectives for OKBC are as follows.

</p><p>
<b>Simplicity:</b> It is important to have a relatively simple
specification that can be implemented quickly, even if that means
sacrificing theoretical considerations or support for idiosyncrasies
of a particular KRS.

</p><p>
<b>Generality:</b>  The protocol should  apply to many
KRSs, and support all the most common KRS features.  For
example, it should support all the knowledge access and
modification functionality that will be required by a graphical KB
editor.  

</p><p>
<b>No legislation:</b>  The
protocol should not require numerous changes to an KRS for
which the protocol is implemented.  That is, the protocol should not
legislate the behavior of an underlying KRS, but should serve as an
interface between an existing KRS and an application.

</p><p>
<b>Performance:</b>  Inserting the protocol between an application and
a KRS should not introduce a significant performance cost. 

</p><p>
<b>Consistency:</b> The protocol should exhibit consistent behavior
across different KRSs.  That is, a given sequence of operations within
the protocol should yield semantically equivalent results over a range
of KRSs.

</p><p>
<b>Precision:</b>  The specification of the protocol should be as
precise and unambiguous as possible.

</p><p>
<b>Extensibility:</b> The protocol must support the variability in
capabilities of KRSs, and the need to add new KRS features over
time without penalizing users of less powerful systems.

</p><p>
Satisfying all of these objectives simultaneously is impossible
because many of them conflict, such as simplicity and precision,
simplicity and generality, and generality and performance.  The
deepest conflicts, however, exist simultaneously between generality,
no-legislation, performance, consistency, and precision, as the
following example shows.  To specify the behavior of the operation
that retrieves the values of a slot precisely and completely, we would
have to specify exactly how the local values of a slot are combined
with the inherited values of a slot (which may be inherited from
multiple parent classes).  That is, we would have to specify the exact
inheritance mechanism that the protocol expects.  Yet, different KRSs
use a variety of different inheritance mechanisms [<a href="#KarpFreview">7</a>].
For a KRS to conform to a precise specification of inheritance, it
might be required either to alter its inheritance mechanism (violating
no-legislation), or to emulate the desired inheritance mechanism
within the implementation of the protocol (violating high performance
and generality, since the inheritance method used by that KRS would
then be inaccessible through the protocol).

</p><p>
The preceding quandary is central throughout the protocol, and we know
of no simple solution to the problem.  Our approach is for each OKBC
implementation to advertise programmatically the capabilities that it
provides.  Each KB manipulated by the protocol is serviced directly by
a single underlying KRS.  The OKBC implementation for that KRS must
declare what set of OKBC <i>behaviors</i> the implementation <em>can</em>
support, and under what set of behaviors it is operating <em>currently.</em>  For example, the implementation might declare that it can
support only one of the two semantics for the behavior <tt>:inheritance</tt>, which we call <tt>:when-consistent</tt> and <tt>:override</tt>.  (If it can support only the <tt>:when-consistent</tt>
behavior, for example, then it must be currently operating under that
behavior.) OKBC predefines alternative KRS behaviors, based on the
properties of existing KRSs.  The application can interrogate the
implementation at any time it feels appropriate to determine which of
several actions the application might take, or whether it needs to
change the current behavior of the underlying KRS.

</p><p>
Many operations in the protocol use language such as, ``The operation
returns <em>at least</em> the values derivable from the definition of
direct assertions.''  This language defines a lower bound on the
capability of any compliant OKBC implementation.  An implementation is
at liberty to deliver more results as long as they are logically
consistent with the documentation of the operation.  In this example,
we are saying that the server must be aware of the class-subclass and
class-instance relationships in the KB, and must perform logically
correct taxonomic inferences.  The same OKBC implementation is at
liberty to perform arbitrary theorem proving as well as the minimal
specified inferences.  Such theorem proving may well derive other
values in addition to those derived by taxonomic inference.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00240000000000000000">
On Terminology</a>
</h1>

<p>
The goal of OKBC is to serve as an interface to many different KRSs.
In a review of KRSs, Karp identified more than 50 of these systems
[<a href="#KarpFreview">7</a>].  He also observed that there is a lack of
agreement regarding terminology in the field of knowledge
representation because different researchers often use different terms
to mean the same thing, and use the same term to mean different
things.  For example, there are 10 different terms for the notion of a
class, 4 terms for an individual, 4 terms for the relationship between
a concept and an individual, 3 terms for the notion of slot values,
and 2 terms for the slot and for the slot frame.

</p><p>
The operations within OKBC require names.  It is clearly impossible to
choose a set of names for the protocol operations that will be
considered ideal by the developers of every KRS.  We ask readers of
this document who are considering adapting the OKBC to their KRS to
recognize these facts, and to be tolerant of the terminology herein.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00250000000000000000">
OKBC History</a>
</h1>

<p>
OKBC is a successor of Generic Frame Protocol (GFP) which was
primarily aimed at systems that can be viewed as frame representation
systems.  GFP was originally motivated by a review of KRSs authored by
Peter Karp [<a href="#KarpFreview">7</a>], by related earlier work by Barnett and
colleagues [<a href="#Barnett91">1</a>], and by specifications used at the
Stanford Knowledge Systems Laboratory for accessing Cyc [<a href="#CYC3">11</a>],
KEE [<a href="#KEE1">10</a>], and Epikit.  Karp and Tom Gruber began developing
OKBC in 1993 for use with the EcoCyc [<a href="#EcoCycNAR96">6</a>], GKB Editor
[<a href="#Karp-JIIS-97">9</a>], and Ontolingua projects [<a href="#ontolingua-96">3</a>].  In
1995 Karp et al. authored a publication describing the version of OKBC
in use at that time [<a href="#KarpGFP95">8</a>].  The protocol has undergone many
revisions, based on input from many people, including Fritz Mueller,
Karen Myers, Suzanne Paley, and Robert MacGregor.

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00300000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="ch:reference-model">&nbsp;</a><br>
The OKBC Knowledge Model
</h1>
The Open Knowledge Base Connectivity provides operations for manipulating
knowledge expressed in an implicit representation formalism called the
<em>OKBC Knowledge Model</em>, which we specify in this chapter.  The OKBC
Knowledge Model supports an object-oriented representation of knowledge
and provides a set of representational constructs commonly found in
object-oriented knowledge representation systems (KRSs) [<a href="#KarpFreview">7</a>].  Knowledge
obtained from an KRS using OKBC or provided to an KRS using OKBC is
assumed in the specification of the OKBC operations to be expressed in
the Knowledge Model.  The OKBC Knowledge Model therefore serves as an
implicit <em>interlingua</em> for knowledge that is being communicated
using OKBC, and systems that use OKBC translate knowledge into and out of
that interlingua as needed.

<p>
The OKBC Knowledge Model includes constants, frames, slots, facets,
classes, individuals, and knowledge bases.  We describe each of these
constructs in the sections below. To provide a precise and
succinct description of the OKBC Knowledge Model, we use the Knowledge
Interchange Format (KIF) [<a href="#kif">4</a>] as a formal specification
language.  KIF is a first-order predicate logic language with set
theory, and has a linear prefix syntax.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00310000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:OKBC-primitive-types">&nbsp;</a><br>
Constants
</h1>
The OKBC Knowledge Model assumes a universe of discourse consisting of
all entities about which knowledge is to be expressed.  Each OKBC
knowledge base may have a different universe of discourse. 
However, OKBC assumes that the universe of discourse always includes all
constants of the following <em>basic types</em>:
<ul>
<li>integers
</li><li>floating point numbers
</li><li>strings
</li><li>symbols
</li><li>lists
</li><li>classes
</li></ul>
<p>
Classes are sets of entities<a name="tex2html3" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot2676"><sup>2.1</sup></a>, and all sets of entities are considered to be
classes.  OKBC also assumes that the domain of discourse includes the
logical constants <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00320000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:own">&nbsp;</a><br>
Frames, Own Slots, and Own Facets
</h1>
A <em>frame</em> is a primitive object that represents an entity in the
domain of discourse.  Formally, a frame corresponds to a KIF constant. 
A frame that represents a class is called a <em>class frame</em>, and a
frame that represents an individual is called an <em>individual frame</em>.

<p>
A frame has associated with it a set of <em>own slots</em>, and each own
slot of a frame has associated with it a set of entities called <em>slot values</em>.  Formally, a slot is a binary relation, and each value V
of an own slot S of a frame F represents the assertion that the relation
S holds for the entity represented by F and the entity represented by V
(i.e., <tt>(S F V)</tt><a name="tex2html4" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot2677"><sup>2.2</sup></a>).  For example,
the assertion that Fred's favorite foods are potato chips and ice cream
could be represented by the own slot <tt>Favorite-Food</tt> of the frame
<tt>Fred</tt> having as values the frame <tt>Potato-Chips</tt> and the string
<tt>``ice cream''</tt>.

</p><p>
An own slot of a frame has associated with it a set of <em>own facets</em>,
and each own facet of a slot of a frame has associated with it a set of
entities called <em>facet values</em>.  Formally, a facet is a ternary
relation, and each value V of own facet Fa of slot S of frame Fr
represents the assertion that the relation Fa holds for the relation S,
the entity represented by Fr, and the entity represented by V (i.e.,
<tt>(Fa S Fr V)</tt>).  For example, the assertion that the favorite foods
of Fred must be edible foods could be represented by the facet
<a href="#:VALUE-TYPE" name="2898"><tt>:VALUE-TYPE</tt></a> of the <tt>Favorite-Food</tt> slot of the <tt>Fred</tt> frame
having the value <tt>Edible-Food</tt>.

</p><p>
Relations may optionally be entities in the domain of discourse and
therefore representable by frames.  Thus, a slot or a facet may be
represented by a frame.  Such a frame describes the properties of the
relation represented by the slot or facet. A frame representing a slot
is called a <em>slot frame</em>, and a frame representing a facet is called
a <em>facet frame</em>.

Classes and Individuals
</h1>
A <em>class</em> is a set of entities. Each of the entities in a class is
said to be an <em>instance of</em> the class.  An entity can be an instance
of multiple classes, which are called its <em>types</em>.  A class can be
an instance of a class.  A class which has instances that are themselves
classes is called a <em>meta-class</em>.

<p>
Entities that are not classes are referred to as <em>individuals</em>. 
Thus, the domain of discourse consists of individuals and classes.  The
unary relation <tt>class</tt> is true if and only if its argument is a
class and the unary relation <tt>individual</tt> is true if and only if its
argument is an individual.  The following axiom holds:<a name="tex2html5" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot2678"><sup>2.3</sup></a>
</p><pre>   (&lt;=&gt; (class ?X) (not (individual ?X)))
</pre>
<p>
The class membership relation (called <em>instance-of</em>) that holds
between an instance and a class is a binary relation that maps
entities to classes.  A class is considered to be a unary relation
that is true for each instance of the class.  That is,<a name="tex2html6" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot2679"><sup>2.4</sup></a>
</p><pre>   (&lt;=&gt; (holds ?C ?I) (instance-of ?I ?C))
</pre>
<p>
The relation <em>type-of</em> is defined as the inverse of relation <tt>instance-of</tt>.  That is,
</p><pre>   (&lt;=&gt; (type-of ?C ?I) (instance-of ?I ?C))
</pre>
<p>
The <em>subclass-of</em> relation for classes is defined in terms of the
relation <tt>instance-of</tt>, as follows.  A class Csub is a subclass of
class Csuper if
and only if all instances of Csub are also instances of Csuper.  That
is,<a name="tex2html7" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot2680"><sup>2.5</sup></a>

</pre>
<p>
Note that this definition implies that <tt>subclass-of</tt> is transitive. 
(I.e., If A is a subclass of B and B is a subclass of C, then A is a
subclass of C.)

Class Frames, Template Slots, and Template Facets
</h1>
A class frame has associated with it a collection of <em>template
slots</em> that describe own slot values considered to hold for each
instance of the class represented by the frame.  The values of
template slots are said to <em>inherit</em> to the subclasses and to the
instances of a class.  Formally, each value V of a template slot S of
a class frame C represents the assertion that the relation <em>template-slot-value</em> holds for the relation S, the class represented
by C, and the entity represented by V (i.e., <tt>(template-slot-value
S C V)</tt>).  That assertion, in turn, implies that the relation S holds
between each instance I of class C and value V (i.e., <tt>(S I V)</tt>).
It also implies that the relation <tt>template-slot-value</tt> holds for
the relation S, each subclass Csub of class C, and the entity
represented by V (i.e., <tt>(template-slot-value S Csub V)</tt>).  That
is, the following <em>slot value inheritance axiom</em> <a name="2194">&nbsp;</a> holds for the relation <tt>template-slot-value</tt>:
<pre>   (=&gt; (template-slot-value ?S ?C ?V)
       (and (=&gt; (instance-of ?I ?C) (holds ?S ?I ?V))
            (=&gt; (subclass-of ?Csub ?C)
                (template-slot-value ?S ?Csub ?V))))
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the values of a template slot are inherited to subclasses as
values of the same template slot and to instances as values of the
corresponding own slot.  For example, the assertion that the gender of
all female persons is female could be represented by template slot <tt>Gender</tt> of class frame <tt>Female-Person</tt> having the value <tt>Female</tt>.  Then, if we created an instance of <tt>Female-Person</tt> called
<tt>Mary</tt>, <tt>Female</tt> would be a value of the own slot <tt>Gender</tt>
of <tt>Mary</tt>.

</p><p>
A template slot of a class frame has associated with it a collection of
<em>template facets</em> that describe own facet values considered to hold
for the corresponding own slot of each instance of the class represented
by the class frame.  As with the values of template slots, the values of
template facets are said to inherit to the subclasses and instances of a
class.  Formally, each value V of a template facet F of a template slot
S of a class frame C represents the assertion that the relation <em>template-facet-value</em> holds for the relations F and S, the class
represented by C, and the entity represented by V (i.e., <tt>(template-facet-value F S C V)</tt>).  That assertion, in turn, implies that
the relation F holds for relation S, each instance I of class C, and
value V (i.e., <tt>(F S I V)</tt>).  It also implies that the relation <tt>template-facet-value</tt> holds for the relations S and F, each subclass
Csub of class C, and the entity represented by V (i.e., <tt>(template-facet-value F S Csub V)</tt>).

</p><p>
In general, the following <em>facet value inheritance axiom</em>
<a name="2213">&nbsp;</a> holds for the relation <tt>template-facet-value</tt>:
</p><pre>   (=&gt; (template-facet-value ?F ?S ?C ?V)
       (and (=&gt; (instance-of ?I ?C) (holds ?F ?S ?I ?V))
            (=&gt; (subclass-of ?Csub ?C)
                (template-facet-value ?F ?S ?Csub ?V))))
</pre>
<p>
Thus, the values of a template facet are inherited to subclasses as
values of the same template facet and to instances as values of
the corresponding own facet.

</p><p>
Note that template slot values and template facet values <em>necessarily</em> inherit from a class to its subclasses and instances. 
Default values and default inheritance are specified separately, as
described in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:default-values">2.8</a>.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00350000000000000000">
Primitive and Non-Primitive Classes</a>
</h1>

<p>
Classes are considered to be either <em>primitive</em> or <em>non-primitive</em> by OKBC.  The template slot values and template facet
values associated with a non-primitive class are considered to specify a
set of necessary <em>and sufficient</em> conditions for being an instance
of the class.  For example, the class <tt>Triangle</tt> could be a
non-primitive class whose template slots and facets specify three-sided
polygons.  All triangles are necessarily three-sided polygons, and
knowing that an entity is a three-sided polygon is sufficient to
conclude that the entity is a triangle. 

</p><p>
The template slot values and template facet values associated with a
primitive class are considered to specify only a set of necessary
conditions for an instance of the class.  For example, all classes
of ``natural kinds'' - such as <tt>Horse</tt> and <tt>Building</tt> - are
primitive concepts.  A KB may specify many properties of horses and
buildings, but will typically not contain sufficient conditions for
concluding that an entity is a horse or building.

Associating Slots and Facets with Frames
</h1>
Each frame has associated with it a collection of slots, and each
frame-slot pair has associated with it a collection of facets.  A facet
is considered to be associated with a frame-slot pair if the facet has a
value for the slot at the frame.  A slot is considered to be associated
with a frame if the slot has a value at that frame or there is a facet
that is associated with the slot at the frame.  For example, if the
template facet <a href="#:NUMERIC-MINIMUM" name="2902"><tt>:NUMERIC-MINIMUM</tt></a> of template slot <tt>Age</tt> of
frame <tt>Person</tt> had a value <tt>0</tt>, then facet <a href="#:NUMERIC-MINIMUM" name="2906"><tt>:NUMERIC-MINIMUM</tt></a> would be associated with the frame <tt>Person</tt> slot
<tt>Age</tt> pair and the slot <tt>Age</tt> would be associated with the frame
<tt>Person</tt>.  In addition, OKBC contains operations for explicitly
associating slots with frames and associating facets with frame-slot
pairs, even though there are no values for the slots or facets at the
frame.

<p>
We formalize the association of slots with frames and facets with
frame-slot pairs by defining the relations <tt>slot-of</tt>, <tt>template-slot-of</tt>, <tt>facet-of</tt>, and <tt>template-facet-of</tt> as
follows: 
</p><pre>   (=&gt; (exists ?V (holds ?Fa ?S ?F ?V)) (facet-of ?Fa ?S ?F))

   (=&gt; (exists ?V (template-facet-value ?Fa ?S ?C ?V))
       (template-facet-of ?Fa ?S ?C))

   (=&gt; (or (exists ?V (holds ?S ?F ?V))
           (exists ?Fa (facet-of ?Fa ?S ?F)))
       (slot-of ?S ?F))

   (=&gt; (or (exists ?V (template-slot-value ?S ?C ?V))
           (exists ?Fa (template-facet-of ?Fa ?S ?C)))
       (template-slot-of ?S ?C))
</pre>
<p>
So, in the example given above, the following sentences would be true: 
<tt>(template-slot-of Age Person)</tt> and <tt>(template-facet-of
:NUMERIC-MINIMUM Age Person)</tt>.

</p><p>
As with template facet values and template slot values, the <tt>template-slot-of</tt> and <tt>template-facet-of</tt> relations inherit from a
class to its subclasses and from a class to its instances as the <tt>slot-of</tt> and <tt>facet-of</tt> relations.  That is, the following slot-of
inheritance axioms hold. <a name="2251">&nbsp;</a>
</p><pre>   (=&gt; (template-slot-of ?S ?C)
       (and (=&gt; (instance-of ?I ?C) (slot-of ?S ?I))

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00370000000000000000">
Collection Types for Slot and Facet Values</a>
</h1>

<p>
OKBC allows multiple values of a slot or facet to be interpreted as a
collection type other than a set.  The protocol recognizes three
collection types: <em>set</em>, <em>bag</em>, and <em>list</em>.  A bag is an
unordered collection with possibly multiple occurrences of the same
value in the collection.  A list is an ordered
bag.

</p><p>
The OKBC Knowledge Model considers multiple slot and facet values to be
sets throughout because of the lack of a suitable formal interpretation
for (1)
multiple slot or facet values treated as bags or lists, (2) the ordering
of values in lists of values that result from multiple inheritance, and
(3) the multiple occurrence of values in bags that result from multiple
inheritance.  In addition, the protocol itself makes no commitment as to
how values expressed in collection types other than <tt>set</tt> are
combined during inheritance.  Thus, OKBC guarantees that multiple slot
and facet values of a frame stored as a bag or a list are retrievable as
an equivalent bag or list <em>at that frame</em>.  However, when the values
are inherited to a subclass or instance, no guarantees are provided
regarding the ordering of values for lists or the repeating of multiple
occurrences of values for bags.  The collection types supported by a
KRS can be specified by a behavior (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:collection-type-behavior">4.1.7</a>) and the collection type of a
slot of a specific frame can be specified by using the <tt>:COLLECTION-TYPE</tt> facet (see Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:std-facets">2.10.2</a>).

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00380000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:default-values">&nbsp;</a><br>
Default Values
</h1>
The OKBC knowledge model includes a simple provision for default values
for slots and facets.  Template slots and template facets have a set of
<em>default values</em> associated with them.  Intuitively, these default
values inherit to instances unless the inherited values are logically
inconsistent with other assertions in the KB, the values have been
removed at the instance, or the default values have been explicitly
overridden by other default values.  OKBC does not require a KRS to be
able to determine the logical consistency of a KB, nor does it provide a
means of explicitly overriding default values.  Instead, OKBC leaves the
inheritance of default values unspecified.  That is, no requirements are
imposed on the relationship between default values of template slots and
facets and the values of the corresponding own slots and facets.  The
default values on a template slot or template facet are simply available
to the KRS to use in whatever way it chooses when determining the values
of own slots and facets.  OKBC guarantees that, unless the value of the
<tt>:default</tt> behavior is <tt>:none</tt>, default values for a template
slot or template facet asserted at a class frame will be retrievable
<em>at that
frame</em>.  However, no guarantees are made as to how or whether the
default values are inherited to a subclass or instance.

A <em>knowledge base</em> (KB) is a collection of classes, individuals,
frames, slots, slot values, facets, facet values, frame-slot

All frames reside in some KB.  The frames representing KBs are
considered to reside in a distinguished KB called the <em>meta-kb</em>,
which is accessible to OKBC applications.

Standard Classes, Facets, and Slots

<p>
The OKBC Knowledge Model includes a collection of classes, facets, and

KB, but if they are, they must satisfy the semantics specified here.

</p><p>
The purpose of these standard names is to allow for KRS- and
KB-independent canonical names for frequently used classes, facets, and
slots.  The canonical names are needed because an application cannot in
general embed literal references to frames in a KB and still be
portable.  This mechanism enables such literal references to be used
without compromising portability.

For example, one could represent the assertion that Fred has exactly
four brothers by asserting 4 as the value of the <a href="#:CARDINALITY" name="3041"><tt>:CARDINALITY</tt></a> own
facet of the <tt>Brother</tt> own slot of frame <tt>Fred</tt>.  Note that
all the values for slot S of frame F need not be known in the KB.
That is, a KB could use the <a href="#:CARDINALITY" name="3045"><tt>:CARDINALITY</tt></a> facet to specify that
Fred has 4 brothers without knowing who the brothers are and therefore
without providing values for Fred's <tt>Brother</tt> slot. 

</p><p>
Also, note that a value for <a href="#:CARDINALITY" name="3049"><tt>:CARDINALITY</tt></a> as a template facet of a
template slot of a class only constrains the maximum number of values
of that
template slot of that class, since the corresponding own slot of each
instance of the class may inherit values from multiple classes and have
locally asserted values.

The <a href="#:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="3053"><tt>:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a> facet specifies the maximum number of
values that may be asserted for a slot of a frame.  Each value of this
facet must be a nonnegative integer.  A value N for facet <tt>MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt> of slot S of frame F means that slot S of frame F

<p>
Note that if facet <a href="#:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="3057"><tt>:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a> of a slot S of a frame F
has multiple values N1,<img width="23" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./okbc2_files/img4.gif" alt="$\ldots$">,Nk, then S in F can have at most <tt>(min N1 </tt><img width="23" height="15" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./okbc2_files/img4.gif" alt="$\ldots$"><tt> Nk)</tt> values.   Also, it is appropriate for a value for
<a href="#:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="3061"><tt>:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a> as a template facet of a template slot of a class
to constrain the number of values of that template slot of that class as
well as the number of values of the corresponding own slot of each
instance of that class since an excess of values for a template slot of
a class will cause an excess of values for the corresponding own slot of
each instance of the class.

</p><p>
Note that a value for <a href="#:MINIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="3077"><tt>:MINIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a> as a template

this facet is either a slot or a slot chain.  A value S2 for facet
<a href="#:SAME-VALUES" name="3089"><tt>:SAME-VALUES</tt></a> of slot S1 of frame F, where S2 is a slot, means

A <em>slot chain</em> is a list of slots that specifies a nesting of

The <a href="#:COLLECTION-TYPE" name="3145"><tt>:COLLECTION-TYPE</tt></a> facet specifies whether multiple values of a

lack of a suitable formal interpretation for the ordering of values in
lists of values that result from multiple inheritance and the multiple
occurrence of values in bags that result from multiple inheritance.

</p><p>
The protocol itself makes no commitment as to how values expressed in
collection types other than <tt>set</tt> are combined during inheritance.
Thus, OKBC guarantees that multiple slot and facet values stored at a
frame as a bag or a list are retrievable as an equivalent bag or list
<em>at that frame</em>.  However, when the values are inherited to a
subclass or instance, no guarantees are provided regarding the
ordering of values for lists or the repeating of multiple occurrences

OKBC Operations</a>
</h1>

<p>
In presenting the functional interface of OKBC, we first describe
concepts that are common to many operations, including common
arguments and standard ways to signal errors.  Then we give an
overview of all the OKBC operations, based on the type of objects on
which they operate.  To facilitate the use of OKBC with multiple
programming languages we describe language bindings for C, Lisp, and
Java.  Finally, we list all the OKBC operations, along with their
input arguments, return values, and descriptions.

</p><p>
The concept of <em>KB behaviors</em>, common to many OKBC operations, is
described in detail in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="#ch:behaviors">4</a>.  On the first
reading of this chapter, any references to KB behaviors can be safely
ignored.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00410000000000000000">
OKBC Architecture</a>
</h1>

<p>
OKBC assumes a client-server architecture for application development.
The client and server can be on different machines, on the same
machine but in a different address space, or on the same machine and
in the same address space.  When the OKBC client and server are on
different machines, they communicate via the OKBC transport layer.  The
OKBC transport layer can be implemented by direct procedure calls if
the client and server are in the same address space, or any of the
standard network protocols (e.g., CORBA or TCP/IP).

</p><p>
Using OKBC, a client application can access any KRS that supports a OKBC
server.  OKBC enables an application to access multiple OKBC servers,
each of which may support multiple KRSs, which in turn may provide
access to multiple KBs.  For example, an application that merged
multiple KBs could access a L<font size="-1">OOM</font> KB on one server, two Ontolingua
KBs on a second server, and place the result in a Classic KB on a
third server.

</p><p>
To access a KB, an application loads the OKBC client library for the
appropriate programming language.  For instance, an application
written in the Java programming language would be compiled with the
OKBC Java client library.  The client library defines Java methods for
all of the OKBC operations.  It also defines Java classes to implement
all of the OKBC entities, and conditions to implement all of the OKBC
conditions.

</p><p>
To access a OKBC server, a client application typically undertakes the
following steps.  First, the application must establish a connection
to a OKBC server (using <a name="4690">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#establish-connection"><b>establish-connection</b></a><a name="tex2html11" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot4667"><sup>3.1</sup></a>).  Second, the application
may find out the set of KRSs that the server supports on that
connection (using <a name="4698">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-types"><b>get-kb-types</b></a>).  Third, the application can get
information about the KBs of a given type that can be opened on the
connection (using <a name="4702">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#openable-kbs"><b>openable-kbs</b></a>).  Finally, the application can
either open a specific KB (using <a name="4706">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#open-kb"><b>open-kb</b></a>) or create a new one
(using <a name="4710">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-kb"><b>create-kb</b></a>).  The application may now query and manipulate
the KB by executing OKBC operations.  For example, it can look for
specific frames (using <a name="4714">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-frames-matching"><b>get-frames-matching</b></a>), find the root
classes of the KB (using
<a name="4718">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-roots"><b>get-kb-roots</b></a>, create new frames (using <a name="4722">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-frame"><b>create-frame</b></a>), and save
changes (using <a name="4726">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#save-kb"><b>save-kb</b></a>).

</p><p>
A back end implementor implements the OKBC operations by using the
KRS's native API.  Whenever there is no direct mapping between a OKBC
operation and some operation in the native API, the back end may
invoke multiple operations in the native API or perform some runtime
translation between the constructs of OKBC and the constructs supported
by underlying KRS.  For example, L<font size="-1">OOM</font> supports a concept definition
language but no facets.  It is possible to translate the L<font size="-1">OOM</font> concept definition language into OKBC facets, for example, the <tt>:at-most</tt> concept constructor of L<font size="-1">OOM</font> is translated into the <tt>:maximum-cardinality</tt> facet.

</p><p>
There is considerable redundancy in OKBC operations -- some operations
can be implemented in terms of others.  For example, consider the
operations <a name="4733">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#class-p"><b>class-p</b></a> and <a name="4737">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#individual-p"><b>individual-p</b></a> that check whether an
entity is a class or on individual.  If we define either of these two
operations, it can be used to define the other, because the domain of
discourse is partitioned into classes and individuals.  The minimal
set of OKBC operations that must be implemented, also known as <em>mandatory</em> methods, is known as a <em>kernel</em>.  Because of this
redundancy, an implementor can choose a kernel that most closely
matches the native API of a KRS.

</p><p>
It is possible to develop a system that implements the complete
protocol using a set of kernel operations.  At least two such system
have been implemented.  As a consequence, a KRS developer can
implement a complete OKBC-compliant system by implementing only the
kernel operations.  This may lead to some loss in efficiency because
some non-kernel operations may have more efficient implementation in
terms of the native API of a KRS.  For example, the operation
<a name="4741">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-classes"><b>get-kb-classes</b></a> can be implemented using <a name="4745">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-frames"><b>get-kb-frames</b></a> and
<a name="4749">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#class-p"><b>class-p</b></a> operations.  Systems that store an explicit list of
classes can return this result more efficiently.

</p><p>
KRS developers can also support subsets of OKBC behavior in their back
ends, and then advertise this using the <em>behaviors</em> mechanism (see
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:behaviors">4.1</a>).  For instance, a back end might only
define read-only operations on a KB.  This further reduces the initial
effort required to implement OKBC.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00420000000000000000">
Notation and Naming Conventions</a>
</h1>

<p>
Many OKBC operations, (for example, <a name="4753">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#slot-p"><b>slot-p</b></a>) are predicates on
their arguments, and the value returned by them is a boolean truth
value. All of these operations are named consistently with ``-p'' as a
suffix.  For example, <a name="4757">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#slot-p"><b>slot-p</b></a> is a predicate that is <em>true</em> for
slots, and <a name="4762">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#class-p"><b>class-p</b></a> is a predicate that is true for classes.
When we say that an operation returns a boolean result, we mean that
it returns either the OKBC value <em>false</em>, which is to be interpreted as
the boolean value <tt>false</tt>, or some non-false value is returned that
is interpreted as the boolean <tt>true</tt>.  Although such a
truth-deciding value will frequently be the OKBC value <em>true</em>, the only
guarantee is that it will not be <em>false</em>.  In some language
implementations, the OKBC values <em>true</em> and <em>false</em> may not be the same
as the native language values for <tt>true</tt> and <tt>false</tt>.

</p><p>
We use a standard format for describing the OKBC operations in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:ops">3.7</a>.  To explain this format, we use an example
description of the <tt>get-slot-values</tt> operation as shown in
Figure&nbsp;<a href="#fig:docstring-format">3.1</a>.

</p><p>
<br>

<p>
<b>Name.</b> The first element is the name of the operation.

</p><p>
<b>Argument list.</b>  The arguments are specified using the Common
Lisp conventions.  The argument list is divided into two groups,
separated by the ``&amp;key'' indicator.  Mandatory arguments precede
``&amp;key''.  These arguments <em>must</em> be provided in all language
bindings.  The keyword (named) arguments follow the ``&amp;key''
indicator.  In Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:bindings">3.6</a>, we discuss language
bindings that show how the keyword arguments should be interpreted for
languages such as C that do not support keyword arguments.  In some
language bindings, the keyword arguments may be optional.  In language
bindings that support optional keyword arguments (for example, Java),
<em>default values</em> will be supplied for the optional keyword
arguments.  The specification of an optional keyword argument is
either (1) a list whose first element is the argument name and whose
second element is the default value or (2) the argument name.
Otherwise, the argument defaults to <em>false</em>.

</p><p>
For example, <b>kb-local-only-p</b> defaults to <em>false</em>, and
<b>inference-level</b> defaults to <tt>:taxonomic</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>Return values.</b> Following ``
<!-- MATH: $\Rightarrow$ -->
<img width="20" height="14" align="BOTTOM" border="0" src="./okbc2_files/img6.gif" alt="$\Rightarrow$">'' are the values
returned by the operation or <em>void</em> if no value is returned. The
operations may return more than one value.  For example,
<b>get-slot-values</b> returns three values -- a list containing
the requested slot values, <b>exact-p</b> and <b>more-status</b>.

</p><p>
<b>Flags.</b> Each operation has a set of descriptive flags to indicate
(1) whether there is a corresponding enumerator operation<a name="tex2html13" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot4493"><sup>3.2</sup></a>
(<font size="-1"><i>E</i></font>), (2) whether it is mandatory, optional or
neither<a name="tex2html14" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot4495"><sup>3.3</sup></a> in the current implementations (<font size="-1"><i>M</i></font>
or <font size="-1"><i>O</i></font> or <font size="-1"><i>I</i></font>), and (3) if it is read-only or writes to the
KB (<font size="-1"><i>R</i></font> or <font size="-1"><i>W</i></font>).  For example,
<a name="4793">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-slot-values"><b>get-slot-values</b></a> has an enumerator, is read-only, and is optional
in the current implementation. 

</p><p>
<b>Documentation.</b>  The documentation defines the meaning of the
operations.  For brevity, common arguments, such as
<b>inference-level</b>, and common return values, such as
<b>more-status</b>,  are not described in the individual operation
definitions, but in Sections&nbsp;<a href="#sec:common-concepts">3.3</a>

Common Concepts

A comprehensive list of all arguments that are common to many OKBC
operations, and their default and legal values, is shown in
Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab:common-args">3.1</a>.  Some of the common arguments are
described later, when we present an overview of the OKBC operations
(Sections&nbsp;<a href="#sec:overview-ops">3.5</a>).

<a name="sec:exact-p">&nbsp;</a><br>
Controlling Inference
</h2>
<a name="4668">&nbsp;</a>
In many situations, it is necessary to control the inferences that
should be performed while executing OKBC operations.  For example,
while retrieving the values of a slot, a user may wish to receive
directly asserted values and perhaps inherited values as well.  To
provide such control, many OKBC operations support an
<b>inference-level</b> argument that can take the following three
values.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When <b>inference-level</b> is <tt>:direct</tt>, at least the directly
asserted values are returned.  If it makes sense, redundant values may
be eliminated.  

<p>
</p></li><li>When <b>inference-level</b> is <tt>:taxonomic</tt>, at least
directly asserted and inherited values are returned.  The inherited
values are computed using the slot and facet value inheritance axioms
(defined in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:template">2.4</a>), slot-of inheritance axiom
(defined in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:attached-to">2.6</a>), and transitivity axioms
for <tt>instance-of</tt>, <tt>type-of</tt>, <tt>subclass-of</tt>, and <tt>superclass-of</tt> relationships (discussed in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#intro:classes">2.3</a>).  If it makes sense, redundant values may
be eliminated.

<p>
</p></li><li>When <b>inference-level</b> is <tt>:all-inferable</tt>, values inferable
by any means supported by the knowledge representation system (KRS) are
returned.

<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
A value of <tt>:direct</tt> for <b>inference-level</b> is guaranteed to
return <em>at least</em> directly asserted values, because in some systems,
such as, forward chaining systems -- values in addition to the
directly asserted values may also be returned. Some OKBC operations, for
example, an operation returning superclasses of a class may eliminate
redundant values from the result.  To help an application determine
when exactly the directly asserted values are returned, all operations
taking an <b>:inference-level</b> argument will return a second value
(the first value being the result of the operation),
<b>exact-p</b>, which is <em>true</em> if it is known that exactly the <tt>:direct</tt> or <tt>:taxonomic</tt> values is returned.  A OKBC implementation that always
returns <em>false</em> as the value of <b>exact-p</b> is compliant, but
implementors are encouraged to return
<em>true</em> whenever possible.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00432000000000000000">
Returning a List of Multiple Values</a>
</h2>
<a name="4669">&nbsp;</a>
For a OKBC operation that returns a list of  values, it is
often desirable to limit the size of the resulting list and the
computation necessary to establish the elements of the list.  The
<b>number-of-values</b> argument, which is supported by many OKBC
operations, allows the caller to limit the number of values returned.
The legal values for this argument are <tt>:all</tt>, which is always the
default, or any positive integer.  A OKBC operation accepting the
<b>number-of-values</b> argument returns at least three values.  The first value is
the result list for the request, the second is the value of
<b>exact-p</b> (discussed in the Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:exact-p">3.3.1</a>), and the third is
<b>more-status</b>, a value that reveals whether there are more
results available.

When <b>number-of-values</b> is <tt>:all</tt>; the value of

Selecting between Default and Asserted Values</a>
</h2>

<p>
<a name="4671">&nbsp;</a>  As discussed in the knowledge
model, OKBC provides a facility to store and retrieve default values.
Therefore, while adding a value to a slot or a facet, one may specify
whether the value being added is a default value.  Similarly, while
retrieving values from a slot (or facet) of a frame, one may choose
whether default values should be returned.  This control is provided
by the <b>value-selector</b> argument.  The argument
<b>value-selector</b> may take one of the following three values.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:default-only</tt> --  For an operation 
adding a new value to the slot (or facet), the value is added as a default
value of the slot (or facet), and for an operation retrieving the slot
(or facet) values, only default values of that slot (facet) are
returned.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:known-true</tt> --  For an operation 
adding a new value to a  slot (or facet), the value is added as a non-default
value of the slot (or facet), and for an operation retrieving the slot
(or facet) values, only non-default values of that slot (or facet) are
returned.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:either</tt> -- For an operation retrieving the slot
(or facet) values, both default and non-default values of that slot (or
facet) are returned depending on the semantics of the default values for
that KRS.  The <b>value-selector</b> cannot be <tt>:either</tt> for an operation that adds a new slot (or facet) value.

<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00434000000000000000">
Test Functions</a>
</h2>

<p>
Many OKBC operations need to perform comparisons.  For example, while
removing a slot value, we need to compare the value to be removed with
the existing slot values.  OKBC operations requiring such comparisons
support a <b>test</b> argument whose value is one of <tt>:eql</tt>, <tt>:equal</tt>, <tt>:equalp</tt>, or a procedure that should be used in the
comparisons.  The <b>test</b> argument defaults to <tt>:equal</tt>.  The
functions invoked for the values <tt>:eql</tt>, <tt>:equal</tt>, and <tt>:equalp</tt> are <a name="4886">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#eql-in-kb"><b>eql-in-kb</b></a>, <a name="4890">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#equal-in-kb"><b>equal-in-kb</b></a>, and
<a name="4894">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#equalp-in-kb"><b>equalp-in-kb</b></a> respectively.  The arguments to a <b>test</b> 
procedure are the two entities to be compared, and the KB for which the
comparison should be performed, and <b>kb-local-only-p</b> (discussed
in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kb-ops">3.5.2</a>).  The <b>test</b> function should return
either <em>true</em> or <em>false</em>.  Supplying a function in the native
programming language as a value of
<b>test</b> is not portable especially in network applications.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00440000000000000000">
Handling Errors</a>
</h1>

<p>
To support the development of robust applications, some standard means  <a name="sec:handling-errors">&nbsp;</a>for processing error conditions are desirable.  Whenever possible, OKBC
operations that experience erroneous conditions or arguments signal
errors.  OKBC uses condition signals that are analogous to C<font size="-1">OMMON</font> L<font size="-1">ISP</font> conditions or Java exceptions.  Condition signals are defined for
commonly occurring error situations. OKBC provides a user with some
control over when the errors should be signaled.  A comprehensive list
of standard OKBC errors is available in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:errors">3.8</a>.

</p><p>
The OKBC errors are said to be either continuable or not.  An error is
said to be continuable only if the state of the KB is not known to
have been changed by the error in such a way that the behavior of
subsequent OKBC operations becomes undefined.  Thus, although the
signaling of a continuable error will interrupt any processing
currently being performed, subsequent OKBC calls will be unaffected.
After a non-continuable error, the state of the KB and the behavior of
the KRS and application are undefined. The operation
<a name="4906">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#continuable-error-p"><b>continuable-error-p</b></a> returns <em>true</em> only for continuable error objects, 
and is <em>false</em> otherwise.

</p><p>
The error behavior of OKBC operations is specified in one of the
following four ways: ``is an error'', ``error is signaled'',
``unspecified behavior'', ``is not portable''.

</p><p>
Whenever we say that ``it is an error'' for some situation 
to occur, it means that no valid OKBC program should cause
that situation to occur; if it occurs, the effects and
results are completely undefined.  No OKBC-compliant implementation
is required to detect such errors, but implementors are encouraged
to detect  such errors when possible.  In some cases
we also specify the condition that should be signaled if an implementation
decides to signal one and has choice over which error is signaled.

</p><p>
When we say that an ``error is signaled'' in a situation, any
OKBC-compliant implementation must signal an error of the specified
type when that situation is encountered.

</p><p>
When we say that ``behavior is unspecified'' for a given situation,
it means that a OKBC-compliant system may or may not treat that 
situation as an error.

</p><p>
An example of a situation where the behavior is unspecified is the
function <a name="4912">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#replace-slot-value"><b>replace-slot-value</b></a> that replaces an existing slot
value with another.  The definition of <a name="4916">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#replace-slot-value"><b>replace-slot-value</b></a> does
not specify whether an error should be signaled when the slot value to 
be replaced is not a current value of the slot, or if the
new value to be added is already a value of the slot.  This approach
simplifies the implementation and speeds performance since each
underlying KRS may make different assumptions about signaling
behavior.

</p><p>
When we say that a particular usage is not portable, we mean that an
application may legally operate in this state, but even if correct
behavior is observed, it is not guaranteed to be the case if the
application is directed at a different knowledge base (KB) of the same
KRS, or the same KB with different behavior settings, or a KB resident
in a different KRS (even with the same content), or a KB connected
over a network.  For example, many KBs uniquely identify frames by
their names.  For a KB with a value <em>true</em> for the behavior <tt>:frame-names-required</tt>, a frame name may be used as a valid argument
for any operation that accepts a frame argument.  Since the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior can be <em>false</em> for some KBs, such
usage is not portable, because a frame name will not always be a valid
argument for an operation that accepts a frame argument.

</p><p>
The general rule is that a standard OKBC error will be signaled
when the documented exceptions occur.  If, for example, the user
attempts to retrieve slot values from a frame that does not exist,
by using a call to the function <a name="4922">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-slot-values"><b>get-slot-values</b></a>, the error
<b>not-coercible-to-frame</b> is signaled.  Errors can also be
signaled when slot constraints are violated.  When a constraint
violation occurs, the KRS should signal one of the conditions defined
for constraint violations.

</p><p>
In two situations, an application program needs 
explicit control of whether an error should be signaled.  An example of the
first situation is the function <b>coerce-to-frame</b> that
coerces a given object to a frame.  In general,
<b>coerce-to-frame</b> signals an error if the input object
cannot be coerced to a frame.  But a user program may not wish an
error to be signaled if it is not sure if the input object is indeed
coercible to a frame.  The second situation is encountered in
functions such as <b>copy-frame</b> that perform multiple operations.
For such functions, a user may wish to continue copying even if there
is an error, in which case the <b>copy-frame</b> continues copying as much
as possible.

</p><p>
<a name="4672">&nbsp;</a>
To provide such control, a few OKBC operations accept an
<b>error-p</b> argument.  The default value for <b>error-p</b> is <em>true</em>,
in which case the errors are signaled as usual.  If <b>error-p</b> is 
<em>false</em>, the operation catches at least the documented conditions and continues execution 
if possible.

</p><p>
The OKBC operations accepting the <b>error-p</b> argument return a
second status value, in addition to the usual return value.  When the
second value is <em>true</em>, and <b>error-p</b> is <em>false</em>, it means that
execution completed successfully.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00450000000000000000">
Overview of OKBC operations</a>
</h1>

<p>
We categorize all the OKBC operations based on the type of objects 
in which they operate.  We introduce here any new concepts  that are necessary
for understanding those operations, and list operations in each category.  Detailed
descriptions of all operations are  in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:ops">3.7</a>.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00451000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:connection-ops">&nbsp;</a><br>
Operations on Connections
</h2>
OKBC has been designed to be easily used in both centralized and
distributed environments.  To permit this, we use
an abstraction called a <em>connection</em> that encodes the actual
location of a OKBC KB  and mediates communication between a OKBC
application and the KB.  To communicate with a KRS, an application
program first establishes a connection by using the
<b>establish-connection</b> operation.  With each OKBC operation, we
need to indicate the connection that should be used in executing it.
Some OKBC operations take an explicit connection argument, whereas
others derive the connection from a KB argument (explained in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:kb-ops">3.5.2</a>).  Thus, once a connection is established, a
user need not be aware of the actual location of the KB or whether
the KB is being accessed from the same address space as the
application or over the network.

<p>
Depending on the nature of the communication and the security model
involved, different types of connection are used to perform the
mediation between a OKBC client and a server.  For example, if a OKBC
server requires user authentication, the client will have to fulfill
the authentication requirement before being able to establish a
connection.  The OKBC specification does not provide a detailed
definition of connections since the specific behavior of the
connections will be a function of the communication, threading,
locking, and security models used by the server.  A provider of a OKBC
server is required to make the definition of its supported connection
types available to the authors of OKBC client programs.

<a name="sec:kb-ops">&nbsp;</a><br>
Operations on KBs
</h2>
Network OKBC operations take a <b>kb</b> argument that specifies the KB
to which the operation applies.  Multiple KBs may be open for access
simultaneously by a OKBC application.  Different KBs may be serviced by
different KRSs.  For example, a single application might
simultaneously access both a L<font size="-1">OOM</font> and a T<font size="-1">HEO</font> KB.

<p>
<a name="5550">&nbsp;</a> <a name="5551">&nbsp;</a> 
With each KB in a KRS, we associate a OKBC KB-object and a KB-locator.
A KB-object uniquely identifies a KB (discussed below) in a OKBC
application.  A KB-locator is a frame in the meta-KB and contains
sufficient information to locate and open the KB.  For example, for a
KB residing in a file, a KB-locator may contain the name of the KB and
its pathname. In effect, a kb-locator is to a KB as a filename is to a
file.  OKBC operations requiring a <b>kb</b> argument must be supplied
with a KB-object.  The <b>kb</b> argument defaults to the current KB,
which is queried by the OKBC operation <a name="5609">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#current-kb"><b>current-kb</b></a> and set by the
operation <a name="5613">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#goto-kb"><b>goto-kb</b></a>.

</p><p>
<a name="5582">&nbsp;</a>
OKBC defines a taxonomy of KB-object types. A KRS may have several
KB-object types defined for it.  For example, one can imagine a type
hierarchy in which the root class is ``KB'', with a subclass
``LOOM-KB'', which in turn has subclasses ``LOOM-FILE-KB'' and
``LOOM-ORACLE-KB.''  A back end implementor may define new KB types
for her purpose, for example, ``CYC-KB''.  Methods defined for KB
types can be used to implement the type-specific KB operations.
Certain OKBC operations must be performed before an application has
created a KB or acquired a reference to a KB object.  Such operations
must be supplied a <b>kb-type</b> argument, which should be the type
object for the KB class for which the operation is to be executed.  A
KB type object for a KB class can be obtained by using the OKBC
operation <a name="5619">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-type"><b>get-kb-type</b></a>.

</p><p>
Our model of KB access allows KBs to reside on different types of
secondary storage devices, including both flat files, and database
systems on remote servers.  We do not assume that the KB is read into
memory in its entirety when the KB is opened for access.  An existing
OKBC KB can be opened using the OKBC operation <b>open-kb</b>.  A new
OKBC KB can be created using the OKBC operation <b>create-kb</b>.  An
open KB may be saved using <b>save-kb</b> or closed using
<b>close-kb</b>. 

</p><p>
The OKBC operation <b>openable-kbs</b> can determine which KBs are available
on a given <b>connection</b> and return KB-locators for such KBs. 
Each such KB-locator can then be used as an argument to <b>open-kb</b>.

</p><p>
Many KRSs allow the creation of new KBs by including existing KBs. The
semantics of KB inclusion vary widely amongst KRSs.  It is
often useful to limit the scope of an operation so that it is
performed to exclude any frames belonging to KBs that were included
in the current KB from some other KBs.  For example, if a client
application wants to display a class graph, it might want to select
the roots of the graph by ignoring frames from any included KBs. To
control such behavior, many OKBC operations take the argument
<b>kb-local-only-p</b>, <a name="5583">&nbsp;</a> which when set 
to <em>true</em> ignores, if possible, any information in the KB that was
included from another KB.  The <b>kb-local-only-p</b> argument always
defaults to <em>false</em>.

</p><p>
<a name="5569">&nbsp;</a>
As was mentioned in Chapter&nbsp;<a href="#ch:reference-model">2</a>, the entities in
the domain of discourse of interest to OKBC exist within a knowledge
base (KB).  Because KBs themselves are of interest to us, every OKBC
implementation must define a special KB, called <em>meta-KB</em> containing frames
that represent KBs themselves.  Such frames representing the KB are
the same as KB-locators.  A meta-kb can be accessed using the OKBC
operation <a name="5635">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#meta-kb"><b>meta-kb</b></a>.

</p><p>
The meta-KB also contains classes corresponding to each
<b>kb-type</b>.  Each KB-locator is an instance of an appropriate
<b>kb-type</b> in the meta-KB.  For example, a KB-locator representing
a L<font size="-1">OOM</font> KB may be an instance of <b>loom-kb</b> KB-type.  

</p><p>
The meta-KB allows the use of the OKBC operations to manipulate
KB-locators.  For example, we could view the contents of a KB-locator
using the OKBC operation (<a name="5643">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#print-frame"><b>print-frame</b></a> kb-locator :kb
(<a name="5647">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#meta-kb"><b>meta-kb</b></a>)).  Similarly, we could use <a name="5651">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-class-instances"><b>get-class-instances</b></a>
to determine all the instances of the KB-type <b>loom-kb</b> as
follows.

</p><p>

Operations on Frames</a>
</h2>

<p>
In OKBC, as many as four identifiers are associated with a frame: <em>frame name</em>, <em>frame handle</em>, <em>frame object</em>, and <em>pretty-name</em>.  Many KRSs associate a <em>name</em> with each frame in a
KB. The frame name can be of type symbol or string.  When the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior is true, a frame name uniquely
identifies a frame.  Some KRSs do not use frame names.  OKBC
parameterizes this behavior of an KRS by setting the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior.  When the value of <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> is <em>true</em>, it means that each frame is required
to have a name, the frame name is unique in a KB, and the frame name
supplied at the time of frame creation can be used at a later time to
identify the frame.  When the value of the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt>
behavior is <em>false</em>, frame names are not required, and may not be
unique in a KB even if supplied; one may not be able to locate a frame by using the
name that was supplied when the frame was created.

</p><p>
A <em>frame handle</em> always uniquely identifies a frame in a KB.  For
some KRSs, a frame handle may be the same as the frame name or the
same as the frame object. Frame handles are always supported by all
the OKBC back ends.  To ensure portability, OKBC application writers are
encouraged always to refer to frames by frame handles.

</p><p>
A <em>frame object</em> is a reference to the actual data structure that
encodes the information about the frame in a KRS.  A frame object
always uniquely identifies a frame in a KB.  Some KRSs may not have a
single data structure representing a frame.  In such cases, the frame
object is not distinguishable from the frame handle, and all
frame-like properties of the frame are emergent from the context of
the KB.  For example, if we view an object-oriented database as a
KRS, then object-identifiers (OIDs) could be viewed as frame handles.
The information about an object identified by an OID does not all
reside in one physical data structure in the database, but the
contents of that object can still be viewed using OKBC.

</p><p>
Any OKBC operation that takes a <b>frame</b> argument must accept either a 
frame handle or a frame object as a valid value.  A frame name is guaranteed to be a valid
value for the <b>frame</b> argument only if the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> 
behavior is set to <em>true</em>.

</p><p>
The frame <em>pretty-name</em> is a name for a frame that is meant for
use in a user interface that needs to display a visually appealing but
terse presentation for a frame.  A pretty-name need not be unique or
suitable for use in a program except for display purposes.

</p><p>
In Table&nbsp;<a href="#tab:frame">3.2</a>, we  summarize how different frame properties
differ along several dimensions. These properties
might differ in a complex implementation  as follows.  The frame
name is a symbol  unique in a KB, but not across different KBs
(different KBs can contain different frames that happen to have the
same frame name).  The frame handle is a data structure  used
by a KRS to represent frames conveniently and efficiently.  It is
guaranteed to be unique only in a KB.  The frame pretty-name is a
string naming the frame in a pretty manner, that happens to be
retrieved from a slot of the frame.

Operations on Slots</a>
</h2>

<p>
The OKBC knowledge model distinguishes between <em>own</em> slots, the
slots that appear in frames, and <em>template</em> slots, slots that are
defined in classes, but are expressed in the frames that are instances
of those classes.  Rather than having a different set of operations for
each type of slot, OKBC has a single set of operations that applies to
both own and  template slots.  Appropriate behavior of these
operations is selected by the <b>slot-type</b> argument that
can take  one of the following three values.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:own</tt> -- The operation applies to the
own slot(s) of the frame.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:template</tt> -- The operation applies to the
template slot(s) of the frame.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:all</tt> -- Applicable only for those
operations that do not take a <b>slot</b> argument, but apply to slots
in general.  All slots will be selected,
whether template or own. 

<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
For an operation that does not take a <b>slot</b> argument,
<b>slot-type</b> defaults to <tt>:all</tt>.  For all other operations
taking a <b>slot-type</b> argument, the default is <tt>:own</tt>.

Enumerators</a>
</h2>

<p>
Many OKBC operations that return a list of results as their first
value, such as <a name="6703">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-classes"><b>get-kb-classes</b></a>, provide an alternative method for
accessing their results.  The alternative is an <em>enumerator</em>,
which can be used enumerate the results one at a time, or even fetch
them in batches.  Enumerators are especially important when operations
return a large list of results; they can also provide a significant
speedup in a networked environment when only a portion of the results
are required.  For certain programming languages, such as Java,
enumerators are a very common programming idiom.

</p><p>
Each enumerated operation, such as <a name="6707">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-kb-classes"><b>get-kb-classes</b></a>, has a
corresponding enumerator operation.  The name of the enumerator
operation is derived from the basic operation by removing the prefix
`<tt>get-</tt>' if any and adding the prefix `<tt>enumerate</tt>'.  The
arguments to the enumerator operations are exactly the same as the
arguments to the basic operations.

</p><p>
There are a small number of operations defined on enumerators to get the
<a name="6711">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#next"><b>next</b></a> element, to determine if an enumerator <a name="6715">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#has-more"><b>has-more</b></a>
elements, to <a name="6719">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#fetch"><b>fetch</b></a> a list of elements, to <a name="6723">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#prefetch"><b>prefetch</b></a> a
batch of elements, and to <a name="6727">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#free"><b>free</b></a> an enumerator.  Note that in
networked environments, prefetching values from the server may result
in a substantial performance benefit.  It is always important to
<a name="6731">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#free"><b>free</b></a> an enumerator that is not yet exhausted but which is no
longer needed.

sentence are defined using some OKBC operation.  In all the OKBC
operations, we assume that the <b>:inference-level</b> is

by the OKBC operation <a name="7327">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#current-kb"><b>current-kb</b></a>.

If we tell the sentence <tt>(person john)</tt>, it will be equivalent to
adding <tt>person</tt> as a type of frame <tt>john</tt>.  If either <tt>person</tt> or <tt>john</tt> does not exist in the KB, the effect will be the
same as the effect of executing <a name="7331">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#add-instance-type"><b>add-instance-type</b></a> when either the frame
or the new type being added does not exist in the KB.  The semantics
of <a name="7335">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#tell"><b>tell</b></a>ing other sentences can be interpreted analogously.

Language Bindings
</h1>

OKBC has been designed to provide access to multiple FRS on multiple
servers in multiple implementation languages.  The OKBC operations have
been specified in a way that is programming language independent.  To
invoke or implement these operations in a specific programming
language, we must establish a binding for the programming language.
Each language binding establishes language specific conventions for
naming, passing arguments, returning values, data structures, and
handling exceptions.

<p>
This section briefly outlines the Lisp, C, and Java bindings for OKBC
operations.  We present enough information for a developer working in
one of these languages to correctly <em>interpret</em> the operation
definitions in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:ops">3.7</a>.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00461000000000000000">
Lisp Binding</a>
</h2>

<p>
The naming and argument conventions provided in the specifications
will be familiar to Common Lisp programmers.  They can be used
directly.  All OKBC operations are defined in the OKBC package.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00462000000000000000">
C Binding</a>
</h2>

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462010000000000000">
Naming</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each OKBC operation name is prefixed with `<tt>okbc_</tt>', and
dashes are replaced by underscores.  For example, the OKBC operation
<a name="8479">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-slot-values"><b>get-slot-values</b></a> is called <tt>okbc_get_slot_values</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462020000000000000">
Arguments</a>
</h4>

<p>
The OKBC operations are defined using mandatory positional and keyword
arguments.  The C programming language, however, does not provide
named keyword arguments.  Therefore, every argument specified for a
OKBC operation must be provided in the order that they appear in the
operation's documentation.  There is no special value to indicate that
the default is to be used.  All values must be explicitly provided.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462030000000000000">
Keywords</a>
</h4>

<p>
All keywords that appear in the OKBC specification are defined as the
values of global variables prefixed by `<tt>key_</tt>'.  For example,
the <tt>:all</tt> keyword is the value of <tt>key_all</tt>.  Because C does
not allow for dynamically allocated structures to be included in
compiled code or header files, the function <tt>okbc_init</tt> must be
called prior to referencing any keywords at runtime.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462040000000000000">
Data Structures</a>
</h4>

<p>
Every OKBC object is implemented as a <tt>Okbc_Node</tt> struct.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462050000000000000">
Return Values</a>
</h4> 

<p>
Each OKBC operation returns a <tt>struct okbc_node *</tt> if it is single
valued, a <tt>struct values *</tt> is returned if it is multi-valued, or <tt>void *</tt> if it returns no values.

</p><p>
C does not support multiple return values from functions.  Operations
returning multiple values return a pointer to a <tt>values</tt> struct.
Functions on <tt>values</tt> include <tt>nth_value</tt>, <tt>first_value</tt>,
and <tt>length</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462060000000000000">
Exceptions</a>
</h4>

<p>
Every OKBC operation clears an error flag before executing, and sets
it if an error occurs.  It is the responsibility of the application to
detect and handle errors.  For the specific error flags, consult the
header file for the C implementation.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00462070000000000000">
Language Specific</a>
</h4>

<p>
Declarations and prototypes are defined in the file <tt>okbc.h</tt>.
The function <tt>okbc_init</tt> must be called prior to executing any OKBC
operation or referencing any keyword at runtime.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00463000000000000000">
Java Binding</a>
</h2>

<h4><a name="SECTION00463010000000000000">
Naming</a>
</h4>
Each OKBC operation that takes a KB argument is defined as a method of
the class <tt>OkbcKb</tt>.  Dashes are replaced by underscores, and the name is
all in lower case.  For example, <tt>get-slot-values</tt> would be called
<tt>kb.get_slot_values(...)</tt>, where <tt>kb</tt> is an instance of the
class <tt>OkbcKb</tt>.

<p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00463020000000000000">
Arguments</a>
</h4>

<p>
Java allows for arguments to be defaulted from right to left.  The
Java binding provides default values for the rightmost arguments that
have simple defaults.  Check the method definitions in the <tt>OkbcKb</tt> class
to verify argument defaulting.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00463030000000000000">
Data structures</a>
</h4>

<p>
The <tt>Node</tt> class is the root class for all OKBC objects.
Subclasses of <tt>Node</tt> include <tt>Symbol</tt>, <tt>Kb</tt>, etc.

</p><p>
All methods implementing OKBC operations return either a <tt>Node</tt> or
a <tt>Values</tt> object or are void methods.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00463040000000000000">
Return Values</a>
</h4>

<p>
Each OKBC operation returns a <tt>Node</tt> object if it is single
valued, a <tt>Values</tt> object if it is multi-valued, or <tt>void</tt> if it returns no values.

</p><p>
Java does not support multiple return values from methods.  Operations
returning multiple values return a <tt>Values</tt> object, which supports
the methods <tt>nthValue</tt>, <tt>firstValue</tt>, and <tt>length</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00463050000000000000">
Keywords</a>
</h4>

<p>
All keywords that appear in the OKBC specification are defined as
public static final members on the <tt>Node</tt> class.  The name of
each keyword is prefixed by `<tt>key_</tt>'.  For example, the <tt>:all</tt> keyword is the value of <tt>Node.key_all</tt>.

</p><p>

</p><h4><a name="SECTION00463060000000000000">
Exceptions</a>
</h4>

<p>
Java has a full exception handling facility.  All OKBC
conditions are implemented as Java conditions.  The root of the
condition graph is <b>OkbcCondition</b>.  The Java condition names are the
same as OKBC conditions, but the first character and the character
following each dash is upper case and the dashes are removed.  For
example, the OKBC condition <tt>constraint-violation</tt> is implemented
by the Java condition class <tt>ConstraintViolation</tt>.

<b>Return Value(s):</b>  frame-handle    <br>
<b>Flags:</b> <font size="-1"><i> O  W </i></font> <br>
Allocates a frame handle in <b>kb</b>.  It is not anticipated that this
   operation will be called by OKBC applications, but rather by OKBC back end
   implementations.  This operation can be used in two distinct ways:
   </p><dl compact="">
<dt>1.
</dt><dd>Given a frame located in an arbitrary KB, typically different
from <b>kb</b>, passing its <b>frame-name</b>, <b>frame-type</b>, and
   <b>frame-handle</b> will return a frame handle to represent that frame if
   such a frame were to be created in <b>kb</b>.  This is useful in OKBC
   operations such as <a name="14275">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#copy-frame"><b>copy-frame</b></a> and <a name="14279">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#copy-kb"><b>copy-kb</b></a> where it is often
   necessary to make forward references to frame objects.  
   </dd><dt>2.
</dt><dd>Providing just a <b>frame-name</b> and a <b>frame-type</b>
   will return a frame handle to represent that frame if such a frame were
   to be created in <b>kb</b>.  This is useful when an implementation wants
   to allocate a frame handle either during the frame creation process, or
   to create forward references to frames when faulting them in from a
   lazy persistent store.  <b>Frame-name</b> may be <em>false</em>.
   </dd></dl>   <b>Frame-type</b> is the type of the frame as identified by the operation
   <a name="14289">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-frame-type"><b>get-frame-type</b></a>; that is, it must be in the set {<tt>:class</tt>,
   <tt>:individual</tt>, <tt>:slot</tt>, <tt>:facet</tt>}.

<p>
The rationale for the arguments to this operation is as follows:
   </p><ul>
<li><b>frame-name</b> - In some KRSs, the name of a frame cannot be
          changed after the frame handle has been allocated.  OKBC therefore
          mandates that the name be supplied.  If the
          <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior has the value <em>false</em>,
          this argument may be <em>false</em>.
</li><li><b>frame-type</b> - In some KRSs, the type of data structure used
          to represent the frame handles of (say) classes is completely
          different from that of (say) individual frames.  OKBC therefore
          mandates that the frame type be specified.  Implementations that use
          the same representation for all frame handles will be able to ignore
          this argument, but it is not portable.
</li><li><b>frame-handle</b> - Some KRSs may choose to use a frame handle
          provided as the value of the <b>frame-handle</b> argument as the
          new frame handle.  This allows implementations that do not have a
          special data structure for frame handles to save memory and to
          maximize the correspondence between the objects in different KBs.
   </li></ul>   The contract of <a name="14301">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#allocate-frame-handle"><b>allocate-frame-handle</b></a> does not require the callee to
   return the same frame handle if called multiple times with identical
   arguments.  Note that this is particularly important in case 2, above,
   with <b>frame-name</b> being <em>false</em>.  It is the responsibility of
   the caller to remember the
   correspondence between its frames and the frame handles allocated.  A frame
   handle allocated using <a name="14307">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#allocate-frame-handle"><b>allocate-frame-handle</b></a> can be used as the
   value of the <b>handle</b> argument to <a name="14312">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-frame"><b>create-frame</b></a>,
   <a name="14316">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-class"><b>create-class</b></a>, <a name="14320">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-slot"><b>create-slot</b></a>, <a name="14324">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-facet"><b>create-facet</b></a>, and
   <a name="14328">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-individual"><b>create-individual</b></a>.  During the execution of these operations, it is
   the responsibility of the <b>kb</b> to preserve any necessary object
   identity so that, for example,
   <pre>   new-handle = allocate-frame-handle(name, :class, kb, handle);
   new-frame = create-class(name, .... :handle new-handle);
   new-handle == get-frame-handle(new-frame) // this identity must hold!

<b>Flags:</b> <font size="-1"><i>E  O  R </i></font> <br>
Asks a <b>query</b> of the OKBC <b>kb</b>.  <b>Query</b> may be any
   sentence in the OKBC Assertion Language that is <a name="14337">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#askable"><b>askable</b></a>.  A
   <a name="14341">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#cannot-handle"><b>cannot-handle</b></a> error
   may be signaled if it is not <b>askable</b>. <b>Reply-pattern</b> is an
   expression mentioning KIF variables contained in <b>query</b>.

</p><p>
<b>Reply-pattern</b> is any list structure mentioning the variables
   in the query, or just the name of a variable.  For example, consider
   a query that is a sentence of the form,
   </p><pre>     (subclass-of ?x ?y)
</pre>   that is, find me the things that are subclasses of other things.  If there
   is a match in the KB for <tt>?x = human</tt> and <tt>?y = animal</tt>.
   - the class <tt>human</tt> is a subclass of the class <tt>animal</tt> - then
   if the <b>reply-pattern</b> were to be
   <pre>     (superclass-of ?y ?x)
</pre>   we would be returned a list of sentences of which one
   would be <tt>(superclass-of animal human)</tt>.  The explicit use of a reply
   pattern in this manner allows the user to get either sentences
   that can be conveniently reasserted using <a name="14350">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#tell"><b>tell</b></a>, or tuples of
   matches in a shape that is convenient to the application.

<p>
When <b>error-p</b> is <em>true</em>, any errors resulting from the execution of
   the query are signaled.  When error-p is <em>false</em>, all possible attempts are
   made to continue with the query and deliver as many results as were
   requested.

</p><p>
If the resources used by <b>ask</b> are a concern, the time (in
   seconds) allowed to answer a query will be limited, if possible, as
   specified by <b>timeout</b>.  If the value of <b>timeout</b> is
   <em>false</em>, an unlimited time is allowed for <b>ask</b> to complete.

</p><p>
The <b>where</b> clause can be used to specify a list of bindings to
   be used for any variables appearing in the <b>query</b>.  During query
   evaluation, such variables are replaced by the values specified by
   <b>where</b>.  A valid value of <b>where</b> is a list of 2-tuples,
   with each tuple consisting of a variable and value pair.

</p><p>
<b>Ask</b> returns three values.

</dt><dd><b>exact-p</b> - This has its normal interpretation.
   </dd><dt>3.
</dt><dd><b>more-status</b> - This has its normal interpretation, except
          that an additional option <tt>:timeout</tt> may be returned for the
          more-status value by <b>ask</b> if the call terminates because
          execution time exceeds the limit specified by the <b>timeout</b>
          argument.
   </dd></dl>   When <b>ask</b> is given a syntactically invalid <b>query</b>, it
   signals the <a name="14376">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#syntax-error"><b>syntax-error</b></a> error.  When <b>ask</b> realizes that
   the <b>query</b> cannot be handled by the KRS, it signals a
   <a name="14382">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#cannot-handle"><b>cannot-handle</b></a> error.

<p>
The following query matches four channel oscilloscopes with a
   bandwidth greater than 80MHz.  It returns a list of pairs <tt>   (?osc ?bandwidth)</tt> satisfying the query.

The <b>frame</b> may contain references to other frames that do not

   <b>Missing-frame-action</b> controls the behavior of <a name="14792">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#copy-frame"><b>copy-frame</b></a> 
   in this case.  It can take one of the following values:

</p><p>
<tt>:stop</tt> - Stop copying and signal a <a name="14796">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#frames-missing"><b>frames-missing</b></a> error,
                   depending on the value of <b>error-p</b>.

   <b>Frame-type</b> is one of {<tt>:class</tt>, <tt>:slot</tt>, <tt>:facet</tt>,

   is coercible to an existing frame.

</p><p>
<b>Direct-types</b> is a list of classes (or class) of which this new

   <b>Direct-superclasses</b> is a list of classes (or class) of which the

   <b>Doc</b>, if specified, is a string documenting the new frame.
   <b>Pretty-name</b> is the pretty-name of the new frame.  Returns
   <b>new-frame</b>, which identifies the newly created frame.

</p><p>
<b>Template-slots</b> and <b>own-slots</b> each take a list of slot 
   specifications.  A slot specification assigns a set of values to a
   slot.  The syntax of a slot specification is
   </p><pre>        slot-spec ::= (slot slot-value-spec*)
        slot-value-spec ::= default-slot-value | slot-value
        default-slot-value ::= (:default slot-value)
</pre>   where <tt>slot</tt> identifies a slot, or names a slot to be created.  If
   <tt>slot</tt> already exists, it is simply attached to the new frame, if
   it does not currently exist, it is created and attached to the new frame.
   Each <tt>slot-value</tt> is an entity suitable as a value of
   the specified slot.  Default slot values are identified by appearing in
   a list whose first element is <tt>:default</tt>.  Template slots are only
   allowed for class frames - that is, when <b>frame-type</b> is
   <tt>:class</tt>.
   
   <b>Template-facets</b> and <b>own-facets</b> each take a list of facet 
   specifications, which can assign a set of facet values.  A facet
   specification has the form:
   <pre>        facet-spec ::= (slot fspec*)
        fspec ::= (facet facet-value-spec*)
        facet-value-spec ::= default-facet-value | facet-value
        default-facet-value ::= (:default facet-value)
</pre>   where <tt>slot</tt> identifies a slot, or names a slot to be created.  If
   <tt>slot</tt> already exists, it is simply attached to the new frame, if
   it does not currently exist, it is created and attached to the new frame.
   <tt>Facet</tt> identifies a facet, or names a facet to be created.  If
   <tt>facet</tt> already exists, it is simply attached to <b>slot</b> on
   the new frame, if it does not currently exist, it is created and attached
   to <b>slot</b> on the new frame.  Each <tt>facet-value</tt> is an object
   suitable as a value of the specified facet.  Default facet values are
   identified by appearing in a list whose first element is <tt>:default</tt>.  
   Template facets are allowed only for class frames - that is, when
   <b>frame-type</b> is <tt>:class</tt>.

<p>
All slot and facet names in slot and facet specs are defined in a unified
   namespace that operates across all of the <tt>:own-slots</tt>,
   <tt>:own-facets</tt>, <tt>:template-slots</tt>, and <tt>:template-facets</tt>
   arguments.  Thus, in the following  example, all occurrences of the slot
   <tt>s1</tt> and the facet <tt>f1</tt> denote the same slot and facet
   respectively.

</p><p>
The values specified in slot and facet specifications are interpreted
   conjunctively.  Thus, in the following example, the slot
   <tt>s1</tt> will have three values; 42, 100 and 2001, rather than just
   the value 2001.
   </p><pre>      (create-frame 'foo :class
                    :own-slots '((s1 42 100)
                                 (s1 2001))
                    :own-facets '((s1 (:value-type :integer))
                                  (s1 (f1 "Own hello")))
                    :template-facets '((s1 (f1 "Template hello"))))
</pre>
<p>
<b>Primitive-p</b> may be used only when creating a class.
   When <b>primitive-p</b> is <em>false</em>, the KRS will make
   the class nonprimitive, if possible.

</p><p>
<b>Handle</b>, if supplied, is a previously allocated frame handle for the
   new frame to be created.  This is used by network applications, and
   operations such as <a name="14954">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#copy-frame"><b>copy-frame</b></a> and <a name="14958">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#copy-kb"><b>copy-kb</b></a>.  (See
   <a name="14962">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#allocate-frame-handle"><b>allocate-frame-handle</b></a>.)  It is an error to supply a value for the
   <b>handle</b> argument that is already coercible to a frame.  If this
   occurs, a <a name="14967">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#frame-already-exists"><b>frame-already-exists</b></a> error should be signaled.

</p><p>
Note that if <b>frame-type</b> is either <tt>:slot</tt> or <tt>:facet</tt>,
   then a <em>frame</em> might not be created because slots (or facets) might not
   be represented as frames in <b>kb</b>.  If this is the case, and slots
   (or facets) with unconstrained domains are not supported, a
   <a name="14973">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#domain-required"><b>domain-required</b></a> error will be signaled.

For example, <b>thing</b> may identify the pathname for a KB that

   </p><ul>
<li><b>arguments</b> - the argument list for the procedure.  The
          argument list can be expressed in one of three forms.
          <dl compact="">
<dt>1.
</dt><dd>A list of symbols
</dd><dt>2.
</dt><dd>A string that is the printed representation of a list

          </dd><dt>3.
</dt><dd><em>false</em>- the null argument list
          </dd></dl>          For example, the argument lists <tt>(a b c)</tt>, and

          The string representation is provided for language bindings in
          which it may be inconvenient to create lists of symbols.
</li><li><b>body</b> - The body for the procedure expressed in the syntax
          defined in section&nbsp;<a href="#ch:funspecs">5</a>.  The body can be
          provided in one of two forms:
          <dl compact="">

</dt><dd>A <tt>body-form</tt>
</dd><dt>2.
</dt><dd>A list of <tt>body-form</tt>s
          </dd><dt>3.
</dt><dd>A string that is the printed representation of a sequence
                 of <tt>body-form</tt>s
          </dd></dl>          For example, the following procedure bodies are equivalent:

           (get-slot-value frame slot :slot-type :own))

</pre>          The string representation is provided for language bindings in
          which it may be inconvenient to create the complex list structure
          required in the procedure language.
</li><li><b>environment</b> - A predefined set of bindings between variables
          mentioned in the procedure <b>body</b> and their associated values.
          The environment is a list of 2-tuples of the form
          <pre>          ((var1 value1)
           (var2 value2)
           ....
           (varn valuen))
</pre>          where <tt>varN</tt> are the variables mentioned in <b>body</b>, and
          <tt>valueN</tt> are the associated values for the variables.
   </li></ul>   A procedure is a legal argument to any OKBC operator in a position that
   expects a procedure.
   For example,
   <pre>    (call-procedure
      #'(lambda (frame) (get-frame-pretty-name frame :kb kb))
      :kb kb :arguments (list my-frame))
</pre>   and

      :kb my-kb :arguments (list my-frame))
</pre>   are semantically identical.

<p>
The main differences between
   procedures and lambda expressions in Lisp are as follows:
   </p><dl compact="">
<dt>1.

<b>Flags:</b> <font size="-1"><i> M  R </i></font> <br>
Given a value from <b>kb</b>, returns a
   <b>decontextualized-value</b>, which contains no KB or KRS-specific
   data structures.  In particular,
   any references to frame objects will be replaced with KRS-independent frame
   handles (produced using <b>frs-independent-frame-handle</b>), and all
   values outside the standard set of OKBC data types that have
   no interpretation outside <b>kb</b> will be
   replaced with remote-value references.  Any frame references that are
   the result of an KRS-specific mapping of a canonically named frame will be
   replaced with the canonical name.  Thus, for example, a facet
   frame called <tt>cardinality-of-slot</tt> would be mapped back to a frame
   handle for the canonical facet-reference <tt>:cardinality</tt>.

</p><p>
<b>From-context</b> is one of {<tt>:frame</tt>, <tt>:slot</tt>,
   <tt>:facet</tt>, <tt>:value</tt>}.  It identifies the context of the argument
   to be decontextualized.  For example, if the
   decontextualization is to be applied to a slot value, then
   <b>from-context</b> should be <tt>:value</tt>.  If the
   decontextualization is to be applied to a slot (i.e., something that would
   be used as a <b>slot</b> argument to an operation such as
   <a name="15144">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-slot-values"><b>get-slot-values</b></a>), then <b>from-context</b> should be <tt>:slot</tt>.

</p><p>
It is not anticipated that this operation will be called by OKBC
   applications, but rather by OKBC back end implementations.  It is used to
   ensure correct operation in networked applications and during communication
   between KBs of different kb-types.<br>

Establishes and returns a connection of type <b>connection-type</b>.
   <b>Initargs</b> are initialization arguments for the connection if one

For example, to initialize some form of network connection, the value of

   <code>(:host "my-host" :port 1234 :username "joe")</code>.

</p><p>

<b>Return Value(s):</b>  list-of-roots    <br>
<b>Flags:</b> <font size="-1"><i>E  O  R </i></font> <br>
Every KB has one or more frames at the top (root) of the
   KB.  A frame <i>C</i> is a root of the KB <i>K</i> if there exists no class <i>D</i> such
   that <i>D</i> is a superclass of <i>C</i> and <i>D</i> is in the KB <i>K</i> and if there
   exists no class <i>E</i> such that <i>E</i> is a type of <i>C</i> and <i>E</i> is in the
   KB <i>K</i>, or available in <i>K</i> when <b>kb-local-only-p</b> is <em>false</em>.  This
   operation identifies and returns those roots, the <b>list-of-roots</b>.
   Note that this means that unparented individuals, slots and facets will
   also be returned.

</p><p>
Some KRSs allow <em>user-defined</em> classes to be roots of a KB, whereas
   other KRSs always import certain <em>system-defined</em> classes (for example,
   <em>thing</em>) into each KB and force all
   user classes to be subclasses of <em>thing.</em> These system-defined classes
   may normally be invisible to the user in some KRSs.  The
   <b>selector</b> argument controls which root classes are returned as
   follows:

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>selector = :all</tt> returns all the true root classes of the 
          KB, regardless of whether they are <em>system-defined</em> or 
          <em>user-defined</em>.
</li><li><tt>selector = :user</tt> returns the user-defined
   root classes of the KB, namely all classes <i>C</i> available in the KB such that
   <i>C</i> was defined by a user application as opposed to being a built-in
   part of every KB, and such that there exists no class <i>D</i> that is both
   <em>user-defined</em> and a superclass of <i>C</i>.  That is, there may
   exist <em>system-defined</em> superclasses of <i>C</i>.
   </li></ul>
<p>
If <b>kb-local-only-p</b> is <em>true</em>, the list returned may return only
   the root classes defined in <b>kb</b> itself; classes that were
   inherited from other (included) KBs may be excluded.  This means
   that a class that has superclasses in some KB included by <b>kb</b>,
   but has no superclasses defined in <b>kb</b>, may be returned as a
   root class if <b>kb-local-only-p</b> is <em>true</em>.

The <a name="15923">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#prefetch"><b>prefetch</b></a> operator is an important optimization in network
   settings.  The client will attempt to prefetch sufficient elements in
   <b>enumerator</b> from the server so that <b>number-of-values</b> elements
   will be immediately available (cached) at the <b>enumerator</b>, using
   only a single network call rather than executing network calls for each 
   element.

</p><p>
If it is discovered that there are fewer than <b>number-of-values</b>
   elements cached locally by <b>enumerator</b>, a minimum chunk of
   <b>increment</b> elements will be prefetched, when available.  Thus, if
   the enumerator already holds five elements locally, and the call
   <code>(prefetch enumerator 7 20)</code>
   is made, the fact that seven elements are requested, but only five are 
   available means that a request will in fact be made to the server for more
   elements, and at least another 20 (as opposed to 2) elements will be 
   prefetched.  When <b>increment</b> is <em>false</em>, the number of elements 
   prefetched will be the difference between the number currently cached in 
   the enumerator and <b>number-of-values</b>.

The <b>untell</b> operation can be used to remove assertions from the
   knowledge base.  Returns <em>true</em> if the sentence was removed, and 
   <em>false</em> otherwise.

</p><p>
The effect of <b>untell</b>ing a sentence of the OKBC Assertion Language
   is equivalent to the effect of executing an equivalent OKBC operation.  
   The OKBC operations equivalent to <b>untell</b>ing a sentence in the
   Assertion Language are specified in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:untell-semantics">3.5.7</a>.
   For example, the operation
   </p><pre>   (Untell `(slot-name frame-name ,slot-value))
</pre>   is equivalent to the OKBC operation <tt>(remove-slot-value 'frame-name
   'slot-name slot-value :slot-type :own).</tt>

<p>
The effect of <b>untell</b>ing an arbitrary <b>tellable</b> sentence
   is not predictable across implementations.  For a given sentence <tt>   s</tt>, executing <tt>(untell s :kb kb)</tt> after executing <tt>(tell s :kb
   kb)</tt> should remove the sentence <tt>s</tt> from the <tt>kb</tt>.  That is, a
   second call to <b>untell</b> should return <tt>nil</tt>.  This
   does not mean that <tt>s</tt> is no longer true, as it may be implied by
   other assertions in the KB.

</p><p>
Some KRSs may allow users to attach an assertion to a frame in the KB.
   If the <b>sentence</b> was attached to a frame, the <b>frame</b>
   argument must be supplied.  The default value for <b>frame</b> is
   <em>false</em>.  When the <b>sentence</b> argument is syntactically invalid, it
   may signal the <a name="16296">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#syntax-error"><b>syntax-error</b></a> error.<br>

<b>Return Value(s):</b>  string location-list    <br>
<b>Flags:</b> <font size="-1"><i> O  R </i></font> <br>
Given some <b>value</b>, returns two values, a string that is a printed
   representation of that value, and a list of three-tuples.
   In the second <b>location-list</b> value, one tuple is supplied for each
   frame reference encountered in <b>value</b> in the order they appear
   in the printed representation.  Each three-tuple is of the form
   <tt>(index0 index1 frame)</tt>, where <tt>index0</tt> is the zero-indexed
   start index of a printed representation of the
   <tt>frame</tt> in the printed representation and <tt>index1</tt> is the
   index one past the end.  For example, printing the list <tt>(#&lt;frame1&gt;)</tt>
   might deliver the values "(Frame1)" and ((1 8 #&lt;frame1&gt;)).

</p><p>
This operation is useful for user interfaces that have no way in
   general to print the arbitrary data structures that might be returned by,
   for example, <a name="16303">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-slot-values"><b>get-slot-values</b></a>.  The second value allows user
   interfaces to print the string with mouse-sensitive regions that point to
   frames.<br>
   <b>Purpose</b>
          - The <b>purpose</b> argument can be one of {<tt>:file</tt>,
             <tt>:user-interface</tt>}.  When it is <tt>:file</tt>, it allows the
             KB to print data in a manner that will be readable again (e.g.,
             for dumping to files),
             preserving object identity where necessary.  The output will
             therefore typically fully escape strings, and will probably
             package qualify symbols.  When <b>purpose</b> is
             <tt>:user-interface</tt>, the string returned will be as pretty
             and readable as possible for a user interface, but such
             output will probably not be readable by OKBC.<br>
   <b>Pretty-p</b>
           - When <em>true</em>, OKBC will attempt to print everything in as pretty a
              manner as possible.  This includes printing frames by using their
              pretty-names, and by printing strings without escaping or
              quotes.<br>

OKBC Conditions
</h1>
Recall that whenever possible, OKBC operations that experience
erroneous conditions or arguments signal errors by using condition
signal.  OKBC conditions classes are defined here, and we present them
in alphabetical order.  Instead of an argument list, conditions have a
list of properties that will be associated with instances of the
condition.  For example, the <b>class-not-found</b> condition has a
<b>class</b> and <b>kb</b> associated with it meaning that
<b>class</b> was not found in the <b>kb</b>.

<b>Condition Type:  </b> <a name="22337">&nbsp;</a><a name="22338">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The abstract OKBC error condition.  <b>Error-message</b>
   is a string to print out for the error.  If the error is not so severe that
   processing with the KB will have undefined results, <b>continuable</b>
   is <em>true</em>.  This is the abstract superclass of OKBC errors.  No
   unspecialized instances of this error type will ever be signaled.<br>

<a name="ch:behaviors">&nbsp;</a><br>
Differences amongst KRSs
</h1>
OKBC supports extensions to the knowledge model to capture the features
of knowledge representation systems (KRSs) that are different from the
core model.  This diversity is supported through a mechanism called
<em>behaviors</em> for a KRS, which provide explicit
models of the knowledge model properties that may vary.  Since KRSs
are different and may not support every aspect of the OKBC knowledge
model, we also discuss what it means for a OKBC back end implementation
to be compliant.

<p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00510000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:behaviors">&nbsp;</a><br>
Knowledge Base Behaviors
</h1>
Each behavior has a name that is a symbol in the keyword package and
is associated with a set of values describing the variations of that
behavior that are <em>supported</em> for a KB.  OKBC does not provide any
operations using which the behavior values supported by a KB can be
specified.  An implementor must encode the values of the behaviors for
each KB type in the implementation so that they can be queried using
<a name="23400">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-behavior-supported-values"><b>get-behavior-supported-values</b></a>.  The initial behavior values for a
KB are the same as the behavior values for its KB-type.  

<p>
The <em>supported</em> values of a behavior can differ from the <em>current</em> value of a behavior.  For example, if a KB type supports both
immediate and deferred constraint checking, the <tt>:constraint-checking-time</tt> behavior will have two <em>supported</em>
values representing alternative times when constraints can be checked.
An application program can choose one of the two values as the <em>current</em> value and expect the KRS to act based on it.  The current
value of a behavior for a KB can be set using the operation
<a name="23404">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#put-behavior-values"><b>put-behavior-values</b></a>.  If a KB supports only one value of a
behavior, its current value is always equal to its supported value.
An application program can query the current value of a behavior of a KB, using
<a name="23408">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-behavior-values"><b>get-behavior-values</b></a> or <a name="23412">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#member-behavior-values-p"><b>member-behavior-values-p</b></a> and use the
result in executing code specific to the values of that behavior.

</p><p>
A user program accesses the behaviors of a KRS either for 
a  KB-type or for a specific KB.  The initial values of the
behaviors a KB are obtained from its KB-type.  The behaviors
of a KB-type, in turn, depend on the behaviors of a KRS.
Therefore, from now on, we use the terms ``behavior of a KB'',
``behavior of a KB-type'' and ``behavior of a KRS'' interchangeably.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00511000000000000000">
Frame Names</a>
</h2>

<p>
As a user convenience, many KRSs allow a user to refer to frames 
by frame names that are unique within a KB.  Some KRSs, however, do
not support such a feature and require use of special data structures,
for example, frame handle, to refer to frames or allow anonymous frames.  A KRS may 
advertise the support for frame names by the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior.  When the value of <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> is
<em>true</em>, it means that each frame is required to have a name,  each frame name
is unique in the KB, and the frame name supplied at the time of
creating a frame can be used at a later time to locate the frame using
<a name="23417">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#coerce-to-frame"><b>coerce-to-frame</b></a> until changed by <a name="23421">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#put-frame-name"><b>put-frame-name</b></a>.  When the 
value of <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> is <em>false</em>, frame names are not
required, and may be non-unique in a KB.  One may not be able to
locate a frame using the name that was supplied when the frame was
created.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00512000000000000000">
Value Constraint Checking</a>
</h2>

<p>
Many KRSs provide runtime constraint checking. For every 
update to a KB, some KRSs evaluate constraints that have been defined
by the user.

</p><p>
Constraint checking is described by three behaviors: <tt>:constraint-checking-time</tt> <a name="23240">&nbsp;</a> controls when constraint checking is
performed,  <tt>:constraint-report-time</tt> <a name="23242">&nbsp;</a> controls when
constraint violations are signaled, and <tt>:constraints-checked</tt>  <a name="23244">&nbsp;</a>
specifies which constraints are checked.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:immediate</tt> -- Constraints
are checked as soon as any side effect causing OKBC operation is
executed. 

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:deferred</tt> -- Constraint checking does not occur when a
side effect causing OKBC operation is executed, but is delayed until
some unspecified time in the future.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:background</tt> -- Constraint checking is performed as a
background process and any violations are discovered asynchronously.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:never</tt> -- Constraints are  never  checked. 
</li></ul>
<p>
The value of <tt>:constraint-report-time</tt> is one of the following

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:immediate</tt> -- Constraint violations are signaled as soon
as they are detected.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:deferred</tt> -- Constraint violations are recorded for later
perusal by the user.
</li></ul>
<p>
The values of the <tt>:constraints-checked</tt> behavior are a set the
standard facet names described in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:std-facets">2.10.2</a>.  The
presence of a facet name in the set of values of <tt>:constraints-checked</tt> means that the KRS checks the constraint defined
by that facet.  For example, if the values of the <tt>:constraints-checked</tt> behavior are {<tt>:value-type</tt>, <tt>:cardinality</tt>}, it implies that every time a value of a slot is
updated, the constraints defined by <tt>:value-type</tt> and the
cardinality of the slot (See Axioms in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:std-facets">2.10.2</a>)
are checked.

</p><p>
The values of the <br>tt :constraints-checked behavior are the
canonical keyword names for the constraint facets and slots defined
in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:std-names">2.10</a>.  The constraint facets are: 
<a href="#:VALUE-TYPE" name="23430"><tt>:VALUE-TYPE</tt></a>, <a href="#:INVERSE" name="23434"><tt>:INVERSE</tt></a>, <a href="#:CARDINALITY" name="23438"><tt>:CARDINALITY</tt></a>, 
<a href="#:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="23442"><tt>:MAXIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a>, <a href="#:MINIMUM-CARDINALITY" name="23446"><tt>:MINIMUM-CARDINALITY</tt></a>,
<a href="#:SAME-VALUES" name="23450"><tt>:SAME-VALUES</tt></a>, <a href="#:NOT-SAME-VALUES" name="23454"><tt>:NOT-SAME-VALUES</tt></a>, <a href="#:SUBSET-OF-VALUES" name="23458"><tt>:SUBSET-OF-VALUES</tt></a>,

The slots on slot frames that represent constraints are:

The presence of any given facet or slot name in the values of this
behavior guarantees that when a value is asserted for that slot (or
facet), the named constraint will be checked by the KRS as specified
by the definition of that slot or facet.  If a slot value <i>V</i> is
asserted for slot <i>S</i> on frame <i>F</i>, and a constraint mentioned in the
<br>tt :constraints-checked behavior applies to <i>S</i> in <i>F</i>, constraint
violations will be signalled for <em>at least</em> those inconsistencies
that can be determined by <em>upwards</em> taxonomic traversal of the
class/subclass/instance hierarchy starting from <i>F</i>.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00513000000000000000">
Frame Representation of Entities</a>
</h2>

<p>
KRSs differ on which entities are represented as  frames in a KB.
For example, in some KRSs, each slot is represented by a frame, which we
call a <i>slot frame</i>, 
whereas, in other KRSs, a slot is represented by  a symbol, and
there is no frame in the KB corresponding to each slot.  The result of
some OKBC operations depends on whether slots are represented as frames.  For
example, if a KRS supports slot frames, the OKBC operation
<b>get-kb-frames</b> will typically include slot frames in its return value.

</p><p>
To encode such differences, OKBC supports a behavior called <tt>:are-frames</tt> <a name="23294">&nbsp;</a> whose value is a set of one or more of the following:
<tt>:class</tt>, <tt>:slot</tt>, <tt>:instance</tt>, <tt>:facet</tt>, and <tt>individual</tt>.  If the value of <tt>:are-frames</tt> contains a certain
entity type, it implies that frames are used to represent those
entities.  If <tt>:slot</tt> is a member of the value of <tt>:are-frames</tt>, it means that slots may be represented by frames.  It
does not, however, preclude the existence of slots that are not
frames.  In most KRSs, classes and instances of those classes are
represented as frames, and therefore we expect the most common set of
values for <tt>:are-frames</tt> to be {<tt>:class</tt> <tt>:instance</tt>}.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00514000000000000000">
Defaults</a>
</h2>

<p>
The behavior called <tt>:defaults</tt> <a name="23308">&nbsp;</a> describes the model of default
inheritance used by a KRS.  The OKBC knowledge model does not take any
position on how the default values are inherited, but the <tt>:defaults</tt> behavior is provided to advertise the support for some
commonly used inheritance algorithms.  The valid values of the <tt>:defaults</tt> behavior include

</p><p>

The behavior called <tt>:compliance</tt> <a name="23317">&nbsp;</a> describes the compliance classes
a OKBC implementation satisfies.    At present, three compliance classes
are defined.

<p>
</p><ul>
<p>
</p><li><tt>:facets-supported</tt> -- Facet operations (listed in 
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:facet-ops">3.5.5</a>) are supported.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:user-defined-facets</tt>  -- Users can create new facets, that
is <a name="23523">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-facet"><b>create-facet</b></a> operation is supported.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:read-only</tt>  -- The implementation supports at least all the 
read operations.  These are the operations with the ``R'' flag in
Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:ops">3.7</a>.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:monotonic</tt>  -- The implementation supports at least all
the operations that monotonically update the KB.  Therefore, any
operations that that delete, remove, or replace any existing
information in a KB may not be supported.  These operations include
all the operations that begin with ``delete'', ``remove'',
``replace'', and ``put''.

<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
The <tt>:user-defined-facets</tt> compliance class is contained in the
<tt>:facets-supported</tt> class.  The <tt>:read-only</tt> compliance class
overlaps the <tt>:facets-supported</tt> compliance class.  The above
compliance classes have been defined based on our past experience in
using KRSs.  We expect the list of compliance classes to evolve with the
continued usage of the protocol.

Class Slot Types</a>
</h2>

<p>
As discussed in Sections&nbsp;<a href="#sec:own">2.2</a> and&nbsp;<a href="#sec:template">2.4</a>, there
can be two types of slots for classes: <b>template</b> and <b>own</b>.  A
<b>template</b> slot is inherited by all instances of the class, while
an <b>own</b> slot describes values associated with that particular
class but  not inherited by the instances of that class or 
necessarily by the subclasses of that class.

</p><p>
Certain KRSs support both <b>template</b> and <b>own</b> slots for
classes, while others support <b>template</b> slots only.  The behavior
<tt>:class-slot-types</tt> <a name="23342">&nbsp;</a> indicates the types of slots
supported by a given KRS. The value of <tt>:class-slot-types</tt>
is a set containing zero or more of the following values.

</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:template</tt> -- Classes support template slots only.
</li><li><tt>:own</tt>  -- Classes support own slots only.

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00517000000000000000">&nbsp;</a>
<a name="sec:collection-type-behavior">&nbsp;</a><br>
Collection-Types
</h2>
The <tt>:collection-types</tt> <a name="23349">&nbsp;</a> behavior specifies how the KRS
interprets multiple values for a slot.  The possible values are

<p>
</p><ul>
<li><tt>:list</tt> -- The order of values of a slot is preserved,
and duplicate values are permitted.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:set</tt> -- The order of values of a slot is neither
guaranteed nor reproducible and duplicate values are not permitted.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:bag</tt> -- The order of values of a slot is
neither guaranteed nor reproducible, and duplicate values are permitted.

<p>
</p></li><li><tt>:none</tt> - Multiple values are not permitted on a slot.
</li></ul>
<p>
Some KRSs may support more than one possible interpretation of
multivalued slots, in which case, the <tt>:collection-type</tt> facet
can be used to specify how multiple values are to be interpreted for a particular
slot.  If a slot has a value for the <tt>:collection-type</tt> facet, it
overrides the value of the <tt>:collection-type</tt> behavior for that
slot.  The default collection type for a slot (when multiple collection
types are supported) is the first member of the list of values of the 
<tt>:collection-type</tt> behavior.  It is an error to change the collection
type for a slot after slot values have been asserted for it.   If the 
collection type for a slot is changed when the slot already has values,
the resulting behavior is undefined.  The <tt>:list</tt> collection type only 
specifies the order of direct slot values.  The order of inherited slot
values for a slot with collection type <tt>:list</tt> is undefined.

Compliance to the OKBC Specification</a>
</h1>

<p>
The OKBC specification allows a considerable variation amongst
the KRSs that may be accessed using it.  Therefore, it is important
for us to understand the minimum requirements that a OKBC back end implementation
must  satisfy.   We have identified  three rules that can
be used to check the compliance of a OKBC back end implementation.

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00521000000000000000">
Compliance Rule 1:  Legal values for all behaviors must be
specified</a>
</h2>

<p>
A OKBC back end must specify a legal value for all the required
behaviors.  As listed in Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:behaviors">4.1</a>, the required
behaviors are <tt>:frame-names-required</tt>, <tt>:compliance</tt>, <tt>:class-slot-types</tt>, <tt>:collection-type</tt>, <tt>:defaults</tt>, <tt>:constraint-checking</tt>, <tt>:are-frames</tt>.  The legal values of
behaviors have been chosen so that a satisfactory value for
representing most KRSs is available. 

</p><p>

</p><h2><a name="SECTION00522000000000000000">
Compliance Rule 2: An implemented OKBC operation must obey
the specification</a>
</h2>

<p>
We say that a OKBC operation is implemented and compliantly obeys the
specification if the following three conditions are met.

</p><p>
</p><dl compact="">
<dd><p>
</p></dd><dt>2a
</dt><dd>It accepts all  legal encounterable values of its input parameters.

<p>
</p></dd><dt>2b
</dt><dd>It must return the documented return values for all legal encounterable inputs.

<p>
</p></dd><dt>2c
</dt><dd>It must have the effects on the KB as specified in the 
knowledge model and the documentation of the operation.

<p>
</p></dd></dl>
<p>
These three conditions have been designed to make it easy to use a
OKBC application across multiple KRSs.  They also allow us to exclude
any trivial OKBC implementations that may provide OKBC operations that
do not conform to the intention of the specification.

</p><p>
For example, the OKBC specification requires that any operation
accepting a <b>frame</b> argument must accept at least a frame handle
or a frame object as a valid argument.  If the <tt>:frame-names-required</tt> behavior is <em>true</em>, the operation must also
accept a frame name as a valid value for the
<b>frame</b> argument.  An implementation that accepts only frame objects
as a valid value for the <b>frame</b> argument will not be  compliant.
Some systems  may not support all values of input arguments.
For example, the OKBC specification defines three values for <b>inference-level</b>:
<b>:direct</b>, <b>:taxonomic</b>, and <b>:all-inferable</b>.  We can imagine 
a KRS that does not support any inferences beyond taxonomic inferences.   It must still accept
<b>:all-inferable</b> as a legal input value for the <b>:inference-level</b>.

</p><p>
OKBC operations must return all the documented return values.  For
example, <b>get-slot-values</b> is documented to returns three values:
a list of slot values, <b>exact-p</b>, and
<b>more-status</b>. To be compliant, it must return these three values.
For a function accepting an <b>error-p</b> argument, with a
value of <em>true</em> for <b>error-p</b>, 
an error must be signaled if required.

</p><p>
OKBC operations must have specified effects on the KB.  For example, an
<b>add-slot-value</b> implementation should result in the addition of
a given value to the specified slot so that it can be retrieved using
the <b>get-slot-values</b> operation.  The OKBC operations have been
documented to a degree of precision that was practical and sufficient
room is left for KRSs to differ.  For example, with an
<b>inference-level</b> value of <tt>:direct</tt>, to be compliant, an
application must return at least locally asserted values.  An
application is free to return additional values without being
non-compliant.

Compliance Rule 3: Systems may choose a compliance class

In Section&nbsp;<a href="#sec:compliance">4.1.5</a>, we defined four compliance classes
-- <tt>:facets-supported</tt>, <tt>:user-defined-facets</tt>, <tt>:read-only</tt>, and <tt>:monotonic</tt>.  The OKBC implementations may choose
to implement a subset of OKBC operations to conform to these compliance
classes.  For example, an implementation that supports all the read
operations satisfying the compliance rule 2, can claim to be
OKBC-compliant in the <tt>:read-only</tt> compliance class.

<a name="ch:procedure_language">&nbsp;</a><a name="ch:funspecs">&nbsp;</a><br>
The OKBC Procedure Language
</h1>
In a networked environment, bandwidth and latency are typically the
limiting factors for system performance.  In order to improve
efficiency in a networked environment, OKBC defines an FRS and
implementation language independent <em>procedure language</em>.  The
procedure language allows an application writer to combine several OKBC
operations into a single call.  If that call requires transmission
over a network, this results in a substantial performance boost.

<p>
For example, computing the information necessary to display a complete
class graph for a knowledge base would require calling at least two
OKBC operations for each class (one to get its subclasses, and one to
get a printable representation of its name).  This could result in
many thousands of calls to OKBC operations.  Using the procedure
language, only a single network call needs to be made; the remaining
calls are executed on the OKBC server and only the results are
transmitted back over the network.

</p><p>
The procedure language supported by OKBC is expressed in a simple
Lisp-like syntax and provides a dynamic binding model for its
variables.  The procedure language supports all of the OKBC operations,
and the ability to create and register new procedures, and a small number
of programming constructs (such as conditionals, iteration, and
recursion).  No operations are supported within the procedure
language that might compromise the security of a OKBC server machine.

</p><p>
The basic object in the procedure language is the <em>procedure</em>.  Procedures are created with <a name="24104">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-procedure"><b>create-procedure</b></a>,
which allows the parameter list, body, and an environment to be
specified.  Once created, a procedure is registered under a name using
<a name="24108">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#register-procedure"><b>register-procedure</b></a>.  It is invoked using the
<a name="24112">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#call-procedure"><b>call-procedure</b></a> operation.

</p><p>

</p><h1><a name="SECTION00610000000000000000">
Procedure Language Syntax</a>
</h1>

<p>
The following grammar specifies the syntax for the parameter list and
the body of a procedure.  Literals in the grammar are enclosed in
string quotes, and token names are in upper case.<a name="tex2html20" href="http://www.ai.sri.com/~okbc/spec/okbc2/footnode.html#foot24103"><sup>5.1</sup></a>
</p><pre>parameter-list ::= "(" parameter* ")"
     parameter ::= SYMBOL
          body ::= body-form*
     body-form ::= procedure-call | simple | binding-form | loop-form
procedure-call ::= "(" SYMBOL body-form* ")"
  binding-form ::= "(" ["LET"|"LET*"] "(" binding* ")" body ")"
       binding ::= "(" SYMBOL body-form ")"
     loop-form ::= "(" "DO-LIST" binding body ")"
        simple ::= atom | quotation
     quotation ::= "(" "QUOTE" form ")" | "'" form
          form ::= atom | list
          list ::= "(" form* ")"
          atom ::= INTEGER | FLOAT | STRING | SYMBOL | true | false
          true ::= "T" | "TRUE"
         false ::= "NIL" | "FALSE" | "()"
</pre>In conditional expressions (e.g., <a name="24116">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#if"><b>if</b></a>, <a name="24120">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#while"><b>while</b></a>), any
non-<em>false</em> value is considered <em>true</em> just as any non-zero
value is considered true in the C language.

<p>
A string literal is enclosed in double quotes.  All characters are
permitted within strings, including newlines and nulls; the double quote
character and the backslash character must be escaped with a backslash
character.  The arguments to
<a name="24126">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#create-procedure"><b>create-procedure</b></a> may be embedded within strings.  This means
that the level of escaping required by the host
language will be necessary.  For example, in Java, a 
procedure body for the expression <tt>(f1 x "hello")</tt> is specified by
the string <tt>"(f1 x <code>\"</code>hello<code>\"</code>)"</tt>.

</p><p>
The procedure language is whitespace-insensitive, but some whitespace
is necessary to delimit tokens other than parentheses and quotes.  The
<tt>INTEGER</tt> and <tt>FLOAT</tt> data types have their normal textual
representation, with exponential notation (as found in Java).  Semicolons
introduce end-of-line comments.  All characters following a semicolon
are ignored until the next newline.  Hash (<tt>#</tt>) characters
are not permitted.

</p><p>
The <tt>SYMBOL</tt> data type has its origins in Lisp, but is supported
by all OKBC servers.  Symbols are used as identifiers for variables and
procedures, but they are also permitted as literals.  Any non-control
character can be part of the name of a symbol, with the exception of
colons, semicolons, hashes, parentheses, quotes, or whitespace.  A
symbol may not start with a digit.

</p><p>
The namespace of symbols is partitioned into regions called <em>packages</em>.  The procedure language is case and package insensitive
except for symbol literals.  It is an error for a portable program to
assume the existence of any package other than the OKBC or keyword
packages in a procedure.  A KB or FRS may define packages other than
the keyword and OKBC packages.  There is no need to be aware of the
packages defined for the KB unless the application specifically needs
to test for object identity with symbol literals defined in the KB.
If this is the case, it is the responsibility of the client program to
create any necessary packages on the client side.

</p><p>
In order to refer to a symbol <tt>X</tt> in a package <tt>FOO</tt>, we write
a double colon between the package name and the symbol: <tt>FOO::X</tt>.
The <em>keyword</em> package holds many symbols that are used
as literals.  Keywords are used so frequently that they have a special
syntax. The symbol <tt>X</tt> in the keyword package is spelled <tt>:X</tt>.
In addition to their special syntax, every keyword is also a global
constant whose value is itself.  Thus, the value of the keyword <tt>:X</tt> is always the symbol <tt>:X</tt>.

</p><p>
Strings, numeric literals, and keywords do not need to be quoted, they
denote themselves.  A quoted literal <tt>xxx</tt> can be expressed either
as <tt>(QUOTE xxx)</tt> or as <tt>'xxx</tt>.  For example, the symbol <tt>FRED</tt> would be expressed as <tt>'FRED</tt>.  A list containing the
elements <tt>A</tt>, <tt>42</tt>, and <tt>"Hello"</tt> would be expressed as
<tt>'(A 42 "Hello")</tt>.  All non-quoted symbols within a procedure body
are either variable references or the names of operators.

</p><p>
Each <tt>body-form</tt> returns a value, although that value may be ignored.
The value returned by a procedure is the value returned by its last
body form.  The first element in a <tt>procedure-call</tt> is the name of an
operator.  That operator is applied to the other body-forms in the
procedure-call - its arguments.  The arguments themselves may be
other procedure-calls.  For example, <tt>(F1 1 2)</tt> means ``apply the
<tt>F1</tt> operator to the numbers <tt>1</tt> and <tt>2</tt>.''  In the C
language, one would express this as <tt>F1(1, 2)</tt>.  Unlike C or Java,
<em>there are no infix operators</em> in the procedure language.  The
equivalent of <tt>1 + 2</tt> in C is <tt>(+ 1 2)</tt>.  Most characters are
permitted in symbols, so whitespace must be used to delimit them.  For
example, <tt>(+1 2)</tt>, means ``apply the operator <tt>+1</tt> to the
number <tt>2</tt>''.

</p><p>
Suppose that <tt>F1</tt> is the name of a procedure whose parameter list
is <tt>(x y)</tt> and whose body is <tt>(* x (+ y 2))</tt>.  I.e., <tt>F1</tt>
returns the result of multiplying <tt>x</tt> by the sum of <tt>y</tt> and
<tt>2</tt>.

</p><p>
Variable names (symbols, such as <tt>x</tt>, above) denote values.
Attempting to retrieve the value of a variable with no assigned value
signals an error.  Variables acquire values either through being <em>set</em>, or through being <em>bound</em>.  Constructs in the language
establish bindings (e.g., <tt>LET</tt>, <tt>DO-LIST</tt>).  The simplest
means of establishing a binding, however, is through being a parameter
to a procedure.  In the above example, the procedure <tt>F1</tt> has <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> as its parameters.  Inside this procedure, we say that
<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are <em>bound</em> to the values passed in to the
procedure when it was called.  If we made a call to <tt>F1</tt> such as
<tt>(F1 3 4)</tt>, <tt>x</tt> would be bound to <tt>3</tt>, and <tt>y</tt> would
be bound to <tt>4</tt> during the execution of <tt>F1</tt>.  On exiting <tt>F1</tt>, <tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are restored to the values they had before,
if any.  During the execution of <tt>F1</tt>, we may <em>set</em> the value
of either <tt>x</tt> or <tt>y</tt> to any other value, but the original
value will still be restored upon exit from <tt>F1</tt>.  OKBC operations
are supported within procedures using the standard Lisp keyword
argument notation.  Thus, if we have a frame that is the value of the
variable <tt>F</tt>, and an own slot that is the value of the variable
<tt>S</tt>, we could get the value of that slot in <tt>F</tt> with the call
</p><pre>       (get-slot-value F S :kb kb :slot-type :own)
</pre>where <tt>kb</tt> is a variable denoting the KB in which <tt>F</tt> resides.
Note that the procedure language syntax may differ from the OKBC syntax
in the implementation language's binding.  For example, in Java code
we would write the above call to <tt>get-slot-value</tt> as
<pre>        kb.get_slot_value(F, S, _own);
</pre>
<p>
We are now in a position to understand a somewhat more complicated
procedure.  The following Java code fragment creates, registers, and
calls a procedure that will return a nested list structure
representing the taxonomic structure below a given class down to a
given maxdepth.
</p><pre> 1 mykb.register_procedure(
 2   mykb.intern("GET-TAXONOMY"),

13     "))";
14 Cons classes = mykb.call_procedure(p, Cons.list(mykb._thing, 0, 4));
</pre>Line 4 specifies the parameter list.  The procedure takes three
arguments: a <tt>class</tt> that is the root of the taxonomy, the current
<tt>depth</tt>, and the <tt>maxdepth</tt>.  Lines 5-13 specify the
procedure body as a multi-line string.  First a binding is introduced
for the variable <tt>pretty-name</tt> using the <a name="24130">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#let"><b>let</b></a> operator.  The
<tt>pretty-name</tt> is bound to the result of calling
<a name="24134">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-frame-pretty-name"><b>get-frame-pretty-name</b></a> on <tt>class</tt>, which was one of the
arguments to the procedure, and the variable <tt>kb</tt>.  The <tt>kb</tt>
variable will be bound by the invocation of <a name="24138">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#call-procedure"><b>call-procedure</b></a> on
line 14.  In line 6, we check the <tt>depth</tt>.  If it is greater than
or equal to the <tt>maxdepth</tt> argument, then we return a list whose
first element is itself a list of the class and its pretty name, and
whose second element is the keyword <tt>:maxdepth</tt>.  This keyword is
being used as a flag to the caller that this class may have
subclasses, but that they were not explored due to the depth limit.
If the depth has not exceeded the limit, then we construct a return
value on line 8.  It is also a list whose first element is also a pair
consisting of the class frame and its pretty name.  The second
element, however, is a list containing one sublist for each subclass
of class.  We collect the subclasses in line 9 by calling
<a name="24142">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#get-class-subclasses"><b>get-class-subclasses</b></a> using <tt>:inference-level</tt> <tt>:direct</tt>.
The <a name="24146">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#do-list"><b>do-list</b></a> operator iterates over the list of subclasses,
binding <tt>sub</tt> to each one in turn, and executing <tt>get-taxonomy</tt> recursively on each subclass in line 12.  The
<a name="24150">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#do-list"><b>do-list</b></a> returns a list with one value for each iteration.  Line
14 actually invokes the <tt>get-taxonomy</tt> function on <tt>mykb</tt>
starting from
<a name="24154">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#:thing"><b>:thing</b></a>, at <tt>depth</tt> 0, up to <tt>maxdepth</tt> 4.  The result
will be a list such as

 ((fr0002 "animal")
  ((fr0003 "mammal")
   ((fr0004 "feline")
    ((fr0005 "cat") :maxdepth))

<p>
<b>and</b> <a name="and">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24822">&nbsp;</a><a name="24823">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Short-circuit conjunction of any number of arguments.  This
is equivalent to the <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator in C or Java.  A
conjunct is true if it is not <tt>NIL</tt>-valued.  The whole

An operator that builds a list by appending its arguments,
each of which must be a list.
For example, if <tt>X</tt> has the list <tt>(D E F)</tt> as its
value, <tt>(append '(A B C) x)</tt> will return
<tt>(A B C D E F)</tt>.<br>

</pre>For example,
<pre>       (do-list (x '(1 2 3 4 5))
          (+ x 100))
</pre>will return <tt>(101 102 103 104 105)</tt>.<br>
<br><hr>
<p>
<b>eql</b> <a name="eql">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24852">&nbsp;</a><a name="24853">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The object identity equality operator.  This operator returns
true if the arguments represent the same object or the arguments
are numbers and the numbers are equal.  This is similar to the
<tt>==</tt> operator in C and Java.<br>
<tt>(eql 42 42) = T</tt><br>

<p>
<b>equal</b> <a name="equal">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24857">&nbsp;</a><a name="24858">&nbsp;</a> <br>
An equality operator like <tt>EQL</tt>, but that also takes
list structure into account, and that treats strings with the
same characters as equal.<br>
<tt>(equal 42 42) = T</tt><br>
<tt>(equal 42.0 42.0) = T</tt><br>
<tt>(equal 'foo 'foo) = T</tt><br>

<b>equalp</b> <a name="equalp">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24862">&nbsp;</a><a name="24863">&nbsp;</a> <br>
An equality operator like <tt>EQUAL</tt>, but that also does
case-insensitive string comparison.<br>
<tt>(equalp 42 42) = T</tt><br>
<tt>(equalp 42.0 42.0) = T</tt><br>
<tt>(equalp 'foo 'foo) = T</tt><br>

<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>error</b> <a name="error">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24867">&nbsp;</a><a name="24868">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Error &lt;&lt;type&gt;&gt; &amp;rest args)</tt> signals an error of the
specified type.  For example,<br>
(error :not-coercible-to-frame :frame fff :kb kb)<br>
signals a <a name="25055">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#not-coercible-to-error"><b>not-coercible-to-error</b></a> error, saying that the value of
<tt>fff</tt> is not a frame in the KB identified by <tt>kb</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>first</b> <a name="first">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24872">&nbsp;</a><a name="24873">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The first element of a list.<br>
<tt>(first '(a b c)) = A</tt><br>
<tt>(first NIL) = NIL</tt><br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>firstn</b> <a name="firstn">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24877">&nbsp;</a><a name="24878">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Returns the zero-indexed first <tt>N</tt> elements of a list.<br>
<tt>(firstn 0 '(a b c d)) = NIL</tt><br>
<tt>(firstn 2 '(a b c d)) = (A B)</tt><br>
<tt>(firstn 9 '(a b c d)) = (A B C D)</tt><br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>getf</b> <a name="getf">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24882">&nbsp;</a><a name="24883">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Getf &lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;key&gt;&gt;)</tt> gets the property value
associated
with the key in the list, where the list is an alternating
list of keys and values.
For example, <tt>(getf '(a 2 b 200) 'b)</tt>
will return <tt>200</tt>.  If the key is not found,
<tt>getf</tt>
returns <tt>NIL</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>if</b> <a name="if">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24887">&nbsp;</a><a name="24888">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The conditional operator.<br>
Syntax: <tt>(if &lt;&lt;condition&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;then&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;)</tt><br>
or      <tt>(if &lt;&lt;condition&gt;&gt; &lt;then&gt;&gt;)</tt><br>
Example: <tt>(if (= x 42) (list x 100) (- x 100))</tt><br>
If <tt>x</tt> is <tt>42</tt> then return the list
containing <tt>x</tt> and <tt>100</tt>,
otherwise return <tt>x</tt> - <tt>100</tt>.
If no <tt>&lt;&lt;else&gt;&gt;</tt> clause is
provided and <tt>&lt;&lt;condition&gt;&gt;</tt> evaluates to <tt>NIL</tt>,
then returns <tt>NIL</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>let</b> <a name="let">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24892">&nbsp;</a><a name="24893">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Establishes bindings for variables and executes a body with
those bindings.<br>
Syntax:
</p><pre> (let ((&lt;&lt;var1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;val1&gt;&gt;)
       (&lt;&lt;var2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;val2&gt;&gt;)
       ....
       (&lt;&lt;varn&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;valn&gt;&gt;))
    &lt;&lt;body expression-1&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;body expression-2&gt;&gt;
    ....
    &lt;&lt;body expression-n&gt;&gt;)
</pre>All the <tt>&lt;&lt;vali&gt;&gt;</tt> expressions are evaluated before
the bindings for the variables are established. I.e., it is
as if the <tt>&lt;&lt;vali&gt;&gt;</tt> are evaluated in parallel.
The value returned by the <tt>LET</tt> expression is the
value of the last body expression.  For example,
<pre>(let ((x '(a b c d))
      (y 2001))
  (push 100 x)
  (push y x)
  x)
</pre>will return <tt>(2001 100 A B C D)</tt>.<br>
<br><hr>
<p>
<b>let*</b> <a name="let_">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24897">&nbsp;</a><a name="24898">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Establishes bindings for variables and executes a body with
those bindings.
Syntax:
</p><pre>   (let* ((&lt;&lt;var1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;val1&gt;&gt;)
          (&lt;&lt;var2&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;val2&gt;&gt;)
          ....
          (&lt;&lt;varn&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;valn&gt;&gt;))
     &lt;&lt;body expression-1&gt;&gt;
     &lt;&lt;body expression-2&gt;&gt;
     ....
     &lt;&lt;body expression-n&gt;&gt;)
</pre>Each <tt>&lt;&lt;valN&gt;&gt;</tt> expression is evaluated and a binding
is established for <tt>&lt;&lt;varN&gt;&gt;</tt> <em>before</em> the system
proceeds to the next binding.  The value returned by the
<tt>LET*</tt> expression is the value of the last body
expression.  For example,
<pre>	(let* ((x '(a b c d))
       (y (list* 2001 x)))
  (push 100 x)
  (list x y))
</pre>will return <tt>((100 A B C D) (2001 A B C D))</tt>.
<tt>LET*</tt> is
equivalent to a series of nested <tt>LET</tt> expressions, so
<pre>(let* ((x 42)
       (y (list x 200)))
  y)
is equivalent to
(let ((x 42))
  (let ((y (list x 200)))
    y))
</pre><br>
<br><hr>
<p>
<b>list</b> <a name="list">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24902">&nbsp;</a><a name="24903">&nbsp;</a> <br>
An operator that builds a list out of its arguments.  List
can take any number of arguments.  The arguments are
evaluated, so you must <tt>quote</tt> any symbol or list
literals, except for keywords, <tt>T</tt>, and <tt>NIL</tt>.
For example, <tt>(list x 42 'x)</tt> returns the list of three
elements; the current value of <tt>x</tt>, <tt>42</tt>, and
the symbol <tt>X</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>list*</b> <a name="list_">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24907">&nbsp;</a><a name="24908">&nbsp;</a> <br>
An operator that builds a list by appending all but its last
argument to its last argument, which must be a list.
For example, if <tt>X</tt> has the list <tt>(D E F)</tt> as its
value, <tt>(list* 'A 'B 'C x)</tt> will return
<tt>(A B C D E F)</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>member</b> <a name="member">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24912">&nbsp;</a><a name="24913">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Member &lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt;)</tt> is true if the value is in
the list.  The operation <a name="25102">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#eql-in-kb"><b>eql-in-kb</b></a> is used to test
equality.
If the value is found, the first sub-list
containing the value is returned.
For example, <tt>(member 42 '(1 2 42 200 2001))</tt>
will return <tt>(42 200 2001)</tt>.  If the value is not found,
member returns <tt>NIL</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>multiple-value-bind</b> <a name="multiple-value-bind">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24917">&nbsp;</a><a name="24918">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Establishes bindings for variables from the multiple values
resulting from evaluating a form and executes a body with
those bindings.
Syntax:
</p><pre>   (multiple-value-bind (&lt;&lt;var1&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;var2&gt;&gt; ... &lt;&lt;varN&gt;&gt;)
       &lt;&lt;values-returning-form&gt;&gt;
     &lt;&lt;body expression-1&gt;&gt;
     &lt;&lt;body expression-2&gt;&gt;
     ....
     &lt;&lt;body expression-n&gt;&gt;)
</pre>A binding is established for each of the <tt>&lt;&lt;vars&gt;&gt;</tt>
from the (at least) N values returned by
&lt;&lt;values-returning-form&gt;&gt;.  The value returned by the
<tt>MULTIPLE-VALUE-BIND</tt> expression is the value of the
last body expression.  For example,
<pre>	(multiple-value-bind (frame found-p)
         (coerce-to-frame thing :kb kb)
        found-p)
</pre>will return the value of the <tt>found-p</tt> flag.<br>
<br><hr>
<p>
<b>not</b> <a name="not">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24922">&nbsp;</a><a name="24923">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The monadic negation operator.  Non-<tt>NIL</tt> values map to <tt>NIL</tt>,
and <tt>NIL</tt> maps to <tt>T</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>nth</b> <a name="nth">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24927">&nbsp;</a><a name="24928">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Returns the zero-indexed Nth element of a list.<br>
<tt>(nth 0 '(a b c d)) = A</tt><br>
<tt>(nth 2 '(a b c d)) = C</tt><br>
<tt>(nth 9 '(a b c d)) = NIL</tt><br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>nth-rest</b> <a name="nth-rest">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24932">&nbsp;</a><a name="24933">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Returns the zero-indexed Nth tail of a list.<br>
<tt>(nth-rest 0 '(a b c d)) = (A B C D)</tt><br>
<tt>(nth-rest 2 '(a b c d)) = (C D)</tt><br>
<tt>(nth-rest 9 '(a b c d)) = NIL</tt><br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>or</b> <a name="or">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24937">&nbsp;</a><a name="24938">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Short-circuit polyadic disjunction.  This is equivalent to the
<code>||</code> operator in C or Java.  A disjunct is true if it is
not <tt>NIL</tt>.  The whole <tt>OR</tt> expression returns the
value of the first non-<tt>NIL</tt> disjunct.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>progn</b> <a name="progn">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24942">&nbsp;</a><a name="24943">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Evaluates all of its arguments in sequence, and returns the
value returned by the last argument.  All arguments but the
last are therefore  interesting only if they perform
side-effects.  For example
<tt>(progn (push 42 x) (push 2001 x) x)</tt>
will push <tt>42</tt> onto <tt>X</tt>, and will then push
<tt>2001</tt> onto the new value of <tt>x</tt>, and will finally
return the current value of <tt>x</tt>.
Thus, if <tt>x</tt> previously had the value <tt>(A B C)</tt>,
it will now have the value <tt>(2001 42 A B C)</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>push</b> <a name="push">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24947">&nbsp;</a><a name="24948">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Pushes a new value onto a list named by a variable.  For
example, if <tt>x</tt> has the value <tt>(B C D)</tt>, then
after evaluating the expression <tt>(push 'A x)</tt>, <tt>x</tt>
will have the value <tt>(A B C D)</tt>.
The call to <tt>push</tt> returns the new value of the
variable.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>quote</b> <a name="quote">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24952">&nbsp;</a><a name="24953">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The <tt>QUOTE</tt> operator denotes a literal object.
<tt>QUOTE</tt> can be used either in the form <tt>(quote foo)</tt> or with
the shorthand syntax <tt>'foo</tt> to denote the literal symbol foo,
as opposed to the value of the variable <tt>foo</tt>.  For example, if
<tt>foo</tt> has the value <tt>42</tt>, then the expression
<tt>(list (quote foo) foo)</tt> will
have the value <tt>(FOO 42)</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>remove</b> <a name="remove">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24957">&nbsp;</a><a name="24958">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Remove &lt;&lt;value&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt;)</tt> returns a new list from
which has been removed all instances of the value in the
original list. The operation <a name="25150">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#eql-in-kb"><b>eql-in-kb</b></a> is used to test
equality.
List order is preserved.
For example, <tt>(remove 42 '(1 2 42 200 42 2001))</tt>
will return <tt>(1 2 200 2001)</tt>.  If the value is not
found,remove will return a copy of the original list.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>remove-duplicates</b> <a name="remove-duplicates">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24962">&nbsp;</a><a name="24963">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Remove-duplicates &lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt;)</tt> returns a new list from
which has been removed all duplicate entries in the original
list.   The operation <a name="25157">&nbsp;</a> <a href="#eql-in-kb"><b>eql-in-kb</b></a> is used to test
equality.
List order is preserved.
For example,
<tt>(remove-duplicates '(1 2 42 200 42 2001))</tt>
will return <tt>(1 2 200 42 2001)</tt>.<br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>rest</b> <a name="rest">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24967">&nbsp;</a><a name="24968">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The tail of a list.<br>
<tt>(rest '(a b c)) = (B C)</tt><br>
<tt>(rest NIL) = NIL</tt><br>
<br></p><hr>
<p>
<b>reverse</b> <a name="reverse">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24972">&nbsp;</a><a name="24973">&nbsp;</a> <br>
The non-destructive reversed elements of a list or string.<br>
<tt>(reverse '(a b c)) = (C B A)</tt><br>
<tt>(reverse "Hello") = "olleH"</tt><br>

<b>setq</b> <a name="setq">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24977">&nbsp;</a><a name="24978">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Sets a new value for a variable.  For
example, <tt>(setq A 42)</tt> assigns the value <tt>42</tt> to
the variable <tt>A</tt>.  It is an error to set the value of
a variable that is not already bound.
The call to <tt>setq</tt> returns the new value of the
variable.<br>

<p>
<b>sort</b> <a name="sort">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24982">&nbsp;</a><a name="24983">&nbsp;</a> <br>
<tt>(Sort &lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;kb&gt;&gt;)</tt> copies the <tt>&lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt;</tt>, sorts the copy,
and returns it.
The elements of the list are sorted according to the
following predicate, with lower ranked values appearing closer to the
front of the resulting list.  If an element of <tt>&lt;&lt;list&gt;&gt;</tt> is itself a
list, then the first element of that element is iteratively taken until a
non-list is found.  A total ordering is established within the data types
understood by OKBC.  Objects of a type that is earlier in the following
table are earlier in the sort.  For pairs of objects of the same type as
shown in the table, the predicate specified in the right hand column is
used.

<b>while</b> <a name="while">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24987">&nbsp;</a><a name="24988">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Loops while a condition is true, executing a body.
Syntax:
</p><pre>  (while &lt;&lt;condition expression&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;body form 1&gt;&gt;
    &lt;&lt;body form 2&gt;&gt;
    ...
    &lt;&lt;body form n&gt;&gt;)
</pre>For example,
<pre> (while (has-more enumerator)
   (push (next enumerator) result))
</pre>will collect all the values in the enumerator by pushing
them onto the list called <tt>result</tt>.  Note that this
will build a list in the reverse order of the list built in
the example for <tt>while-collect</tt>.<br>
<br><hr>
<p>
<b>while-collect</b> <a name="while-collect">&nbsp;</a>  <a name="24992">&nbsp;</a><a name="24993">&nbsp;</a> <br>
Loops while a condition is true, collecting up the results of
executing a body.
Syntax:
</p><pre> (while-collect &lt;&lt;condition expression&gt;&gt;
   &lt;&lt;body form 1&gt;&gt;
   &lt;&lt;body form 2&gt;&gt;

</pre>For example,
<pre> (while-collect (has-more enumerator)
