 etc, etc



The 'Roadmap' aspects of this have been superceded by:
  http://www.noosphere.org/discuss/zwiki/NooronRoadmap

Principles Guiding ToDo Prioritization
  - scratch own itch
  - do tough stuff early (to ensure they affect design early)
  - release early, and have something usable (to promote participation)
      (opposed to scratch own itch?)

TODO (prioritized as above, roughly)
  - deliver templates by version

  - store evaluations (in sql?)
  - create evaluation facilities
  - filter/sort/format things on the basis of evaluations 
      (or other attributes)
 
  - ensure that here/blah uses acquisition-like something
  - test root/blah and container/blah
  - implement adding of topics
    - set up form and action architecture
      - early uses to include:
        - loading KBs
        - creating frames
        - creating KBs
        - save_as

  - create user authentication system
    - implement NotSoBasicAuth

  - create a nano-fsa 
  - display weblog.xtm
  - generate some svg now
  - time for users


TODO for nanotech scenario
  - create ontology for scenarios
