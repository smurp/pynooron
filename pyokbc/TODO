TODO

* PyOkbc must support operations minimally required by Nooron:
** fix recursion error when Node._THING._direct_types = [Node._CLASS]
important so that taxonomic roots are available for hanging skins on
** implement kb_type, kb_locator and load kbs by name w/o ext
** enforce DOMAIN constraints on slot values 
** enforce slot-based constraints first
** test facets values (in prep for constraints)
* features not absolutely required by Nooron
** get_slot_values_in_detail
** meaningful implementation of default values
*** value_selector sensitivity in get_slot_values


coerce slot values appropriately (so they are frames too)
** coerce_to_handle [how the hell does a handle work]

* cleanup
** move get_class_superclasses to KB or TupleKb
** clean up Node._*_all and make them into a dict keyed by _*
** improve Getting Started section of INSTALL
