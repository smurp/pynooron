TODO for PyOKBC

* PyOkbc must support operations minimally required by Nooron:
** get_kb_direct_children not working fully?
** get_class_instances should work a little bit
** get_class_subclasses should work a little bit
** automatic reload of .pykb files when change detected on disk
** PERFORMANCE
*** clarify when PRIMORDIAL_KB should be poked into kb._parent_kbs


** enforce DOMAIN constraints on slot values 
** enforce slot-based constraints first
** test facets values (in prep for constraints)

** implement kb_type, kb_locator and load kbs by name w/o ext
*** so /know/SomeKB.pykb returns the .pykb source
*** /know/SomeKB/ surfs the kb as usual

* features not absolutely required by Nooron
** clean out old, unused methods and unused recursion cruft
** implement all mandatory OKBC functions
** meaningful implementation of default values
** value_selector sensitivity in get_slot_values

** cache intermediate results (types, slots, instances, etc.) on frames
** make a SentenceKB
*** saves to sentences
*** permits 'deletion' of inherited results

coerce slot values appropriately (so they are frames too)
** coerce_to_handle [how the hell does a handle work]

* cleanup
** move get_class_superclasses to KB or TupleKb
** clean up Node._*_all and make them into a dict keyed by _*
** improve Getting Started section of INSTALL
