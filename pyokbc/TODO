TODO

* PyOkbc must support operations minimally required by Nooron:
** ensure that PRIMORDIAL_KB is in meta-KB
** enforce DOMAIN constraints on slot values 
** test facets values (in prep for constraints)

coerce slot values appropriately (so they are frames too)
** coerce_to_handle [how the hell does a handle work]

* cleanup
** move get_class_superclasses to KB or TupleKb
** clean up Node._*_all and make them into a dict keyed by _*
** improve Getting Started section of INSTALL
