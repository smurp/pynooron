To install PyOKBC:

 0) Use python 2.x

    Efforts have been made to keep the code 1.5.2 clean, but there were
    a few failures to use string.* instead of the built-in string methods.
    When OKBC enumerations start being supported then

 1) Untar the puppy.

      tar -xvzf pyokbc-0.1.0.tgz

 2) Install the aforementioned puppy.

    Just plunk it wherever you want to use it and rename it to pyokbc or
    install it in the site-packages directory of your Python installation
    by running the command:

      python setup.py install

 3) Getting started:

    Take a look at the stuff in tests/*
