To install Nooron:

 0) Use python 2.1.x 

    This is because Zope 2.5 does not work with python 2.2.
    Note that Zope is not ultimately required in its
    entirety.  It is just that a separate distribution of 
    the Zope Page Template technology has not yet been created 
    which includes all the required goodies from Zope that it
    requires.  Hints in this direction are given at:
      http://www.zopelabs.com/cookbook/998065931

 1) Install the Goose-Works Toolkit (GWTK) (maybe post 0.5 required)

 2) Install Zope 2.5 or later (presumably).

 3) Untar nooron-x.x.x.tgz somewhere you want to run it from.

    The python modules which constitute Nooron are intentionally
    not installed within site-packages as conventional modules are.
    The reason is that one of the nearterm goals is for Nooron
    to actually expose its own python code to modification by
    users at runtime.  Yes, this sounds a little odd.

 4) Edit nooron.py 

    Things you might need or want to do:
       - indicate the topicmaps you want to publish
       - adjust for your python 2.1 location
       - adjust for your Zope installation location
       - adjust for your IP and port

 5) Start it with ./nooron.py
