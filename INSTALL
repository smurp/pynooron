To install Nooron:

 0) Untar nooron-x.x.x.tgz somewhere you want to run it from.

 1) Install Zope 2.5.1 (preferably the binary distribution, because it 
    comes with a Python 2.1.3 suitable for running Nooron)
      http://zope.org/Products/

    There are currently two reasons Nooron requires Python 2.1.3:
      1) PyOKBC (which is included in the Nooron tarball) has a problem
         with Python 2.2 for some reason.  Give me a hand with this if you can.
      2) Zope 2.5.1 requires it (and Nooron uses Zope's Page Template code)
         There are now several ZPT implementations in Python, but the one
         which comes as *part* of Zope is required because Nooron needs the
         restricted execution capabilities which only that ZPT implementation
         seems to offer.  If I have the facts wrong, please tell me.

 2) Install Medusa 0.5.3 (or later, presumably, if more come along)
      http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/

 3) Install XML-RPC for Python (xmlrpclib)
      http://www.pythonware.com/products/xmlrpc/

 4) Edit nooron.py 

    Things you might need or want to do:
       - change the user from 'smurp' to the uid you want the process to run as
       - adjust for your python 2.1 location (is it Zope's python?)
       - adjust for your Zope installation location (for the ZPT code)
       - adjust for your IP and port
       - adjust for the authentication mechanism you want to use
       - adjust the cache_dir location (this director MUST exist)

 5) Start it with ./nooron.py from within your nooron-x.x.x directory.

 6) If you want to generate all the various output types you need to do more:
    
    The docbook transformations (from .dbk to .rtf, .ps, .pdf, .tex) are 
    supported by the RPM: docbook-utils-0.6.11-2 which seems to come with, at 
    least RedHat 8.0 and Mandrake 9.x

    The .dot file transformations (into .jpg, .svg, .ps) are performed by
    graphviz-1.8.10 available from http://www.graphviz.org

    The support for .dot will likely be replaced by the use of the GPLed
    graphing package called VCG.  I encourage its use as much as possible.
    I had already implemented several graphs with GraphViz when a non-obfuscated
    version of the VCG package was finally released:
