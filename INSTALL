To install Nooron:

 0) Use python 2.1.x 

    This is because Zope 2.5 does not work with python 2.2.
    Note that Zope is not ultimately required in its
    entirety.  It is just that a separate distribution of 
    the Zope Page Template technology has not yet been created 
    which includes all the goodies from Zope that it requires.  
    Hints in this direction are given at:
      http://www.zopelabs.com/cookbook/998065931

 1) Install the Goose-Works Toolkit (GWTK) (maybe post 0.5 required)
      http://www.goose-works.org
    Gooseworks can use MySQL (and Postgresql too, I think), but Nooron
    requires neither.  Gooseworks does require expat.

      In Makefile change:
          /usr/include/python1.5 to /usr/include/python2.1 
      make all
      make python
      cp lib/GW* /usr/lib/python2.1/site-packages/
      

 2) Install Medusa 0.5.2 (or later, presumably, if more come along)
      http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/

 3) Install Zope 2.5 or later (presumably).
      http://zope.org/Products/

 4) Untar nooron-x.x.x.tgz somewhere you want to run it from.

    The python modules which constitute Nooron are intentionally
    not installed within site-packages as conventional modules are.
    The reason is that one of the near-term goals is for Nooron
    to actually expose its own python code to modification by
    users at runtime.  Yes, this sounds a little odd.  The idea is
    basically to replace the whole release-use-modify cycle with 
    the modify-use-rate-filter cycle.

 5) Edit nooron.py 

    Things you might need or want to do:
       - indicate the topicmaps you want to publish
       - adjust for your python 2.1 location
       - adjust for your Zope installation location
       - adjust for your IP and port

 6) Start it with ./nooron.py from the nooron-x.x.x directory.
