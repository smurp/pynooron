To install Nooron:

 0) Use python 2.1.x 

    This is because Zope 2.5 does not work with python 2.2.
    Note that Zope is not ultimately required in its
    entirety.  It is just that a separate distribution of 
    the Zope Page Template technology has not yet been created 
    which includes all the goodies from Zope that it requires.  
    Hints in this direction are given at:

 1) Install Medusa 0.5.2 (or later, presumably, if more come along)
      http://oedipus.sourceforge.net/medusa/

 2) Install Zope 2.5 or later (presumably).

 3) Untar nooron-x.x.x.tgz somewhere you want to run it from.

 4) Edit nooron.py 

    Things you might need or want to do:
       - adjust for your python 2.1 location
       - adjust for your Zope installation location
       - adjust for your IP and port

 5) Start it with ./nooron.py from the nooron-x.x.x directory.
